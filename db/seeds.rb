Of generations of generations.', time: 5, content: 'Entrepreneurs are the proudest achievement of a generation. Of generations of generations. We look at these people in disbelief. How did they have the courage, gut, risk-profile, innovative mind, ‘insert any other success factor here’? We sit back and wish.
If only we could have those traits. If only we could find the idea, have the guts to spend some money, take on some risk. If only. Then maybe we’d be living our dream life, taking care of our destiny, building the career of our dreams.
We name publications after them, we scroll through memes about them, we read articles about what it’s like to be them. We are, for all intents and purposes, obsessed with being successful.
But as we click off of INC.com we go back to our desk job. We go back to the regular. The dream stays alive in our heads but nowhere else.
As a scientist by training and a business scientist in work (yep that’s kind of my job), it has become curious to me the intersection between business and science. Is there any way to figure out if you’re more likely to be a successful entrepreneur? Well, we’re about to find out.
The personality of a successful entrepreneur
It’s of no surprise that the first place we start when looking at what makes a successful entrepreneur is personality. From our screen we look at the success we see all around us and it’s easy to correlate that success with characteristics we all see.
Outspoken.
Driven.
Go-getter.
We could all write down a list of traits that we think makes a successful entrepreneur. But back in the 1980s, science concluded quite the opposite. In fact, researchers concluded that there was zero correlation between personality and a successful entrepreneur. It was all just a sea of randomness.
But a question like that wasn’t going to lie dead for long. With the re-emergence of the 21st obsession with success, the lid has been lifted once again on the link between personality and successful entrepreneurs. Not satisfied with the answer, researchers began to ask what makes people most likely to pursue a career by themselves and importantly what traits make them most likely to be successful.
The big-5 personality traits
According to academics, the big-5 personality traits have been linked directly to career choices. In other words, who you are affects what you choose to do with your life. Go figure.
The ‘big-5 model’ brackets the biggest 5 personality traits in a model:
extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)
With the advent of this new model, it was only a matter of time until a scientist put two and two together and started to work out what makes a successful business owner.
Shelley M Farrington explored this very question. Farrington wanted to understand what personalities successful small business owners displayed and she found out the answer by, you guessed it, applying the science. She sent questionnaires out to several hundred business owners with varying levels of success. After receiving 383 back she used some clever maths to find out one thing.
Do certain personality traits have a significant impact on a business’s success. And the answer? Yes.
“The findings of this study show that individuals who have high levels of the personality traits Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Openness to experience are more likely to have successful small businesses.” — Farrington
But the science doesn’t stop there — oh no
Now, we all know the trials and tribulations of the entrepreneur. It’s why many of us do not dare to dip our toe too far into the water through fear of falling in. A pre-requisite of becoming an entrepreneur is to be able to cope with failure.
If you can’t cope with the inevitable, if you can’t dance when you’re failing and learn to enjoy the ride then you might as well get off right now.
In the hilariously titled research paper ‘“I’m Loving It!’ What Makes the Successful Entrepreneur Affectively Committed to Entrepreneurial Performance” researchers found that there are certain behaviours that make entrepreneurs more likely to find success.
The study interviewed 6 highly successful entrepreneurs and found the following:
“We find that affective commitment is the main component of commitment influencing entrepreneurial performance, and that passion in pursuing goals, coupled with positive inherited and learned values, and the possession of exceptional personality are found to positively influence the successful entrepreneurs’ aspirations to endure the challenges and unpredictable failures.”
In other words, people that were to be positive and have a passion for pursuing their goals were able to endure the challenges that come with the entrepreneurial lifestyle.
But if it was that simple it would be too easy
Like with everything else in science, there are always other views to be explored and other avenues left unexamined which then paves way for new scientists to look at the same problem, with a different lens.
Cue the research into the social entrepreneur.
What is a social entrepreneur you might ask? Well, it’s anyone that is starting a business to solve a social, cultural or environmental issue. This shines a different light on this whole personality thing.
All of a sudden we’re not talking about the accumulation of piles of wealth Jeff Bezos style, or we might be but at least there is a benefit to the world too. Here, the social entrepreneur throws a spanner in the works.
In a similar vein, a study looking into social entrepreneurs asked the same question. Which of the big-5 personality traits matter for success as a social entrepreneur?
“The findings reveal that agreeableness positively influences all dimensions of social entrepreneurship, whereas openness exerts a positive influence on social vision, innovation and financial returns.”
Agreeableness may not of been a personality trait you would have associated with entrepreneurial success. It might actually have been the lowest on the list. But as always, what we see on the TV doesn’t always reflect the reality of real life.
So do you have the personality for entrepreneurship?
Oh, absolutely.', category: Category.first)

It’s easy to say, “stop spending so much money on the three biggest categories: housing, transportation, and food,” but often much harder to actually make the changes that will cut costs.
Here are 3 mental barriers that might be stopping you save more money — and how to overcome them.
1. Reliance on convenience
After a busy day at work or an exhausting day looking after the kids, a pre-prepared meal or takeout sounds very appetizing.
And when we look at Google Maps, and the route involves a metro, a bus, and then a 10-minute walk, we fire up Uber faster than you can say “taxi!”
But convenience has its price.
The average American orders takeout 2.4 times per week, adding up to almost $3,500 per year. When it comes to ride-hailing apps, San Franciscans spend on average $1,320/year on Uber and $1,068 on Lyft.
Our want for convenience isn’t limited to just food and transportation, though — it invades the big one too: Housing.
We often choose our home because it offers convenience for the work commute or has all our favorite stores and restaurants nearby. Which generally means the more desirable, expensive part of town.
Of course, your time is worth something. Buying a house in the cheap part of town, which then burdens you with a very long walk — or taxi ride — to the station every day might not make sense.
But there are tradeoffs that we can often make that would save us money without having to make our lives more difficult.
Takeaways:
Choosing to cook more meals at home from scratch rather than choosing pre-prepared meals or ordering takeout can result in huge savings. It doesn’t have to feel like a chore or that we are depriving ourselves either.
With a bit of planning ahead of time, we can prepare delicious, indulgent meals that still work out cheaper than takeout. Make an effort to make your home feel like the best restaurant in town — set the mood with your favorite music, open a nice bottle of wine and relax in the knowledge that you’re still saving money. Or get the kids involved and turn cooking into a fun family activity.
Likewise, a bit of planning in order to ensure we have enough time to make our journey by public transport or bike can reduce our reliance on apps like Uber. Or try to change your mindset such that you see that hour’s walk less as an inconvenience and more as an opportunity to be mindful or to listen to a podcast. After all, do we always need to take the fastest route?
When it comes to housing, homes in the neighborhood where I chose to live were on average 22% cheaper than the fancier part of town just a mile down the road. This enabled me to cut my expenditure on housing to just 2.9% of my income and cut years off my journey to financial freedom.
You might find that the huge savings you can make are more than worth the tradeoff of a little inconvenience every so often.
2. Your need for comfort
We all need some comfort in our lives. But our perceived need for ever more comfort often leads to huge expenditure.
Our closets are overflowing with clothes for every occasion, even though 82% of those items have not been worn in the last year.
We reward ourselves with upgrades to Business Class flights and 5* hotels.
We crank up the AC as soon as the sun comes out — the US uses more air conditioning than the rest of the world combined, adding up to $29 billion on electricity each year.
I know I’ve been guilty of spending in search of comfort. I spent hundreds of dollars on a fancy mattress and a duvet for every season so that I’d sleep comfortably, whatever the weather.
But do we really need all that comfort?
Takeaways
We all need to have our basic needs for comfort met. I’m not suggesting you sleep on the floor.
But you don’t always need more comfort. And much of the money we spend in the search for comfort won’t actually get you what you want.
What I have realized since becoming a nomad living out of Airbnbs is that I can sleep well in any bed now that I have a simpler, less stressful life. I didn’t actually need to spend all that money chasing comfort through purchasing ever more comfortable bedding.
Having only one suitcase of possessions inevitably means I sometimes don’t have the perfect clothes for the situation. There were unexpectedly cold nights last winter when I would have definitely been more comfortable with a thicker winter coat.
But discomfort is fleeting. The contentment that comes from a simple, financially free life is more than worth the tradeoff of occasional sub-optimal comfort levels. 3. Keeping up with the Joneses
No one thinks they have a problem with keeping up with the Joneses.
But we all do, in one way or another.
Sure it might not be as obvious as chasing the huge detached mansion with 5 cars on the driveway. I never wanted that, and I thought anyone who spent money to impress other people was an idiot.
But looking back over the last few years, I definitely spent money in order to keep up with the Joneses. I just spent it on experiences rather than things. And the Joneses weren’t my neighbors; they were the people I followed on social media.
I traveled to fancy Michelin-starred restaurants around the world, posting photos of every perfectly presented dish and an iconic bottle of wine on Instagram but ultimately coming away from the meal feeling lukewarm about the experience.
Takeaways
Whether we would like to think so or not, we all have Joneses who influence our spending.
Maybe they are your family, friends, neighbors, or simply people you follow online.
We can all be convinced to spend money on things or experiences that we don’t need in search of approval from others. In my case, it was food and wine. Yours might be skiing vacations or weekends in Vegas. Or maybe even whatever meme stock is being pumped this week.
Take care to think honestly about your spending and whether it really brings you value.
To sum up
Saving money is not difficult, but there are certain inbuilt behaviors that can make changing our spending patterns more challenging.
In our busy lives, we are constantly chasing convenience. We reward ourselves with comfort. And we seek approval from others via our spending.
If we can start to break down these mental barriers, we can start to make more intentional decisions about our spending.
As these barriers have a big effect on how we spend our money on the biggest categories of food, transportation, and housing, any improvements we make will have a huge impact, helping us to pay down debt or reach financial freedom sooner.', category: Category.first)

People ask me via social media how I made enough money to face retirement in the next five years.
They seem to think I have many secrets about how to make enough money to retire that can change their life. Here’s how I did it.
1. Invest your money rather than save.
Saving your money is stupid. Inflation will eat away at your money. You make money when you invest what you have in real assets.
2. Understand the idea of purchasing power.
Governments print money to fight recessions, and fund wars. When they do, they take away the purchasing power of the money you have earned. The only way to repay the huge debt the US Government has racked up is by either: 1) Raising taxes 2) Printing money out of thin air.
Increasing taxes won’t repay the debt. That leaves option two which we’ve been doing as a global economy since 2008. You can overcome the attack on your purchasing power when you learn about inflation hedge assets.
3. Lose all of your money.
Let money show you another side to life. Start a business with your family. Choose a marketplace to sell on. Import goods from China. Buy low and sell high. Let the business become huge. Bring on investors and see that they are like having a boss whip you with a whip.
Believe you were destined to be a hot shot entrepreneur. Take the money from your online business and pour it into cars and free drinks for attractive people you want to sleep with. Become a total ass in the process. Treat people like absolute dirt. Tell poor people to work harder. Abuse random charities and tell them to stop asking for donations. Let your ego run your life.
Start a second business using your overconfidence from the first business. Park your car each morning in the reserved car space for BMWs and Mercs only. Get out of the car and slam the door like a boss. Keep your head up so you look confident. Walk into the office and give advice to people twice your age. Take the intersection of luck and the rise of the internet for granted. Tell yourself you’re amazing and you built this empire because you’re brilliant.
Go out on the weekends and try and pickup using your money. Flash $100 bills. Talk down to the bar staff. Tip service workers like they’re your slaves and you’re the emperor. Wear loafers that cost twice the weekly minimum wage of a person you call a ‘worker.’
While all of this is going on, get greedy. Not just a little bit greedy. Treat your family like they serve you now. Don’t visit your grandparents or repair broken relationships with aunties and uncles. You’re too busy hustling and making money. Keep making the money. Watch the problems enter your life. Watch those problems get out of control.
See, in a matter of months, your money-making machine almost crumble because of one bad decision. Realize the end is near. Find yourself out on the streets late at night talking to your employees and predicting conspiracies. Watch yourself lose your mind from all the money and the thought of it been taken away from you. Watch your self-worth become your net-worth.
Show up to the office one day and realize it’s all over. Say goodbye to the employees while you hold back tears. Pretend to be strong when you know you’re weak. Offer to give them references for their next job, knowing you’ll be lucky to find a job yourself.
Go home when it’s all over. Sell the luxury car. Catch trains to visit friends. Learn what it’s like to have nothing. Check your bank account and see your savings evaporate fast. Trade in the luxury life for a simple life that is enforced by how much money you have in your back pocket. Accept the gift of an old car from a kind family member you neglected when you had your business.
Drive their car back to your empty home. Pick up the car cleaning accessories you had for your BMW. Take the car down to the local car wash and see if you can shine it into something that resembles the BMW. Watch your worst nightmare, a big spider, jump out from underneath the car. Scream at the top of your voice and then watch it crawl away.
Finish cleaning the car and notice how it hasn’t morphed into anything you could imagine in your dreams. Feel slightly grateful you even have a car for a few brief moments.
Return home and look for a job. Apply for everything. Watch the phone never ring and the thought of moving in with distant family, to survive, become a reality. Keep trying. Pick up the phone one Monday morning and talk to a nice lady named Fiona on the other end. Say hi and pretend to be okay when you’re not okay. Say yes to the job interview knowing something is wrong… you feel sick.
See the doctor. Try and find out what is wrong with you. Try all of their suggestions: a change in diet, fructose tests, colon inspections. Roll up the following week for the job interview. Have the thought of presenting your failed business journey almost bring you to tears. Watch your hands shake and feel the sweat drip down your back and stink out the interview room.
Get a call saying you made it. You got a job in a call center working for a bank. Notice the contrast between making loads of money and earning minimum wage. Work at the bank for eight years. Learn about how money works. Serve people who have money, and who don’t have money.
Spend your time after work learning about different assets: stocks, real estate, gold, digital currencies, bonds, cash. Apply the knowledge and invest what you earn. Take the money you earn from being a part-time writer and invest it, too. Feel like you’re smart with money. Watch the money grow. Make enough money to cover all of your expenses for a year, in advance. Feel no different.
Simultaneously, work on yourself. Face your inner demons. Get help. Face mental illness too. Be kind to yourself. Realize you’re doing the best you can. Forgive yourself for your messy past, where you acted like a dictator with too much money. Say sorry to the people you hurt. Forgive people who you banned for life because they violated one of your rules. Forgive people for no reason at all.
Look at what makes you happy now: family, your partner, messages from readers, mending of broken relationships.
Feel what it’s like not to run towards money. Notice how fancy cars, houses and luxury goods have zero appeal to you. Take the simple things in life and let them change your life.
Have money allow you to buy back your time, instead of spending money on things that create a never-ending trail of debt. Make the acquisition of wealth secondary. Focus on how you can be helpful. Get excited by all the people you can meet and do life with.
Learn to make a difference rather than a profit.

At the time I write this, the S&P 500 is up;
16.7% year to date.
87% since the market bottomed in March 2020.
27% since its pre-COVID peak in February 2020.
During this time, many new investors have piled into the market and gotten the sense that the stock market will always continue “to the moon,” for lack of a better phrase.
The past 18-months in the stock market have been anything but normal, and if history is any guide, the gravy train might soon end. That does not mean I am going to stop investing in the stock market, but I am taking some steps to insulate my financial situation from a future bear market or recession.
Expected lower returns moving forward
When interest rates are low (like today), the expected return of interest-paying assets like bonds is low. Most people understand that; think of how little interest you earn in a savings account these days.
But what many people don’t realize is that low interest rates also mean lower expected returns in risky assets like stocks. The difference between stock market returns and a risk-free asset like a Treasury Bill (T-bills) is called the risk premium.
We still expect stocks to outperform T-bills, but lower returns on the risk-free imply lower future returns for stocks.
That’s exactly what Credit Suisse’s 2021 report on global investment returns is forecasting.
In their report, Credit Sussie broke down past investment returns enjoyed by past generations.
Baby boomers: Includes annual returns since 1950.
Gex X: Includes annual returns since 1970.
Millennials: Includes annual returns since 1990.
Gen Z: This shows the expected investment returns moving forward.
The forecasted returns are negative for bonds after accounting for inflation. Someone investing in bonds today might expect a negative 0.5% real return on investment.
Which drags down expected returns for stocks. Again, notice the expected returns for “Gen-Z” or anyone putting money in the stock market today is less than half of what it was during the Boomer generation peak earning years.
Take these with a grain of salt because these are “expected returns,” which are far from a guarantee. But here’s the bottom line:
There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the historically high returns we’ve experienced in the stock market will not continue.
Bear markets are an unpleasant reality
A bear market is when the stock market drops by 20% or more since its most recent peak.
You could technically call what happened in 2020 a bear market, but it only lasted a few weeks. We haven’t had a prolonged bear market since the 2008 financial crisis.
Bear markets are an inescapable reality for long-term investors, and they happen more frequently than new investors might think.
Over the past 100 years, the U.S stock market has gone into 14 bear markets.
The length of these bear markets has varied from 1 month in 2020 to over 5 years in 1937.
The market declines of these bear markets have also varied significantly from 20% in 1990 to 86% in 1929.
A bear market can’t ruin a long-term investor
If you invest in the entire stock market through low-cost index funds, there’s only one way to guarantee you lose money:
Selling when the market is down and turning a “paper loss” into a real loss
Investors sell at the bottom of the market for two reasons.
They try (and fail) to time the market.
They lose their job.
I have written a lot about why trying to time the market is a bad idea. In summary: If you are thinking about trying to time the market, don’t.
What get’s a lot less attention is people who are forced to sell at the bottom of the market because they lost their job and need to access their investments to pay the bills.
Two ways to insulate yourself from bear markets and recessions
The first thing you can do is to have a cash emergency fund to fall back on in case of, well, a financial emergency like losing your job.
(For more details on how to build an emergency fund, read this story.)
My uncle is a historian of colonial times, and he always used to say that the very best fortresses were the ones that were never attacked.
I look at emergency funds the same way; the best emergency fund is one you never need to use.
We can extend that logic a step further and conclude:
If you don’t need to touch your emergency fund, you won’t need to liquidate your investments at the worst possible time.
This brings me to the second thing you can do to insulate yourself from bear markets and recessions:
Create a second income stream that you own.
Diversification of your most important asset
Most people accept that it’s smart to diversify your investments like buying an index fund rather than the stock of an individual company. But when it comes to your most important asset, your human capital, most people have zero diversification.
They put all their eggs in one basket AKA their paycheck from their 9–5.
Lack of diversification in your human capital can put you in the position where you need to sell your investments at the worst possible time.
Bear markets and recessions often happen at the same time.
It’s also the time where you are most likely to get laid off from your job.
If that job is your only source of income, you’ll need to dip into your emergency fund.
Once the emergency fund is empty, you may need to liquidate your portfolio at a time where prices are way down.
This is the only investment risk that keeps me up at night.
At least, it used to be before I added a second stream of income by building up a side hustle that earns enough to cover my basic living expenses.
This provides an extra layer of financial defense and lowers the odds that I’ll ever need to access my emergency fund or my investment portfolio, even if I lost my 9–5 job.
I used to believe that I am some badass investor who can watch his investments drop by 50% and not even bat an eye. But in all honesty, I am the furthest thing from a badass. I just know that I have multiple sources of income that shield me from the pain of selling off investments at the worst possible time.
Having multiple streams of income can help you build an unbreakable financial defense.
It can also help you go on offense and “Run up the score.” Bear markets are where the future rich build their wealth, but only if they have the money to invest.
I was fortunate enough to hold onto both of my income streams during the 2020 market crash and recession. That meant that I had a lot of extra money to invest, and since I invested at the bottom, those dollars I put in during the recession are up nearly 90% over the past year.
Personal finance can be really simple if you let it be. If you can increase and diversify your income, set money aside in an emergency fund, and use what’s left over to buy assets, you’ll put yourself in a prime position to outlast any bear market or recession.', category: Category.first)

Satoshi Nakamoto
Bitcoin’s top ten richest Bitcoin owners in the years-the creator of Bitcoin-are nicknamed “Satoshi Nakamoto”. According to Satoshi Nakamoto’s early mining, the number of bitcoins he currently owns is estimated to be around 1.1 million. If one bitcoin is worth $20,000 today, it is worth about $22 billion. But Satoshi Nakamoto has never used most of his bitcoins, nor converted them into real-world currencies, nor used them for any other purpose. If he sells all bitcoins, the value of bitcoins may plummet in an instant.
2. Bulgaria
Bulgaria is currently sitting on one of the world’s largest bitcoin assets. In May 2017, Bulgarian law enforcement agencies cracked down on organized crime and confiscated 213,519 bitcoins, enough to pay off a quarter of the country’s national debt. According to the Bulgarian authorities, these criminals used their technology to avoid taxation. By June 2018, the value of the virtual currency will exceed US$1.2 billion. The Bulgarian government declined to comment on the status of gold coins.
3. BitFinex
There are 163,133.38 bitcoins in the wallet of the encrypted bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, which is one of the largest bitcoin wallets in the world. It is said that these bitcoins are placed in a cold wallet to protect them from cyberattacks.
4. FBI
The FBI is one of the largest well-known holders of Bitcoin. In September 2013, they took the notorious “dark web drug bazaar” Silk Road and confiscated 144,000 bitcoins owned by the website operator. It is said that since the launch of the “Silk Road” website in 2011, the number of bitcoins on the website has reached 9.5 million bitcoins. Although the FBI sold numerous bitcoins they held, and even all bitcoins, it is worth mentioning that they made a fortune by selling bitcoins. Most of the confiscated bitcoins were sold to Barry Silbert.
5. The Winklevoss Twins
One of the top ten richest Bitcoin owners. In 2013, the twins bought 1.5 million Bitcoins with 11 million U.S. dollars of the 65 million U.S. dollars in compensation received from a legal dispute with Zuckerberg. At the time, the transaction price of one bitcoin was $120. Since then, investment has increased by more than 20,000%. Allegedly, the twins own 1% of Bitcoin on the market. They founded Windex, funded several Bitcoin-related companies, and invested 1.5 million US dollars in BitInstant.
6. Gavin Andresen
Although Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto’s idea, Gavin Andresen is believed to be the creator of Bitcoin. Gavin was suspected to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but he denied it. Instead, he said that he and the anonymous cryptographer had a friendship for many years. The real Satoshi Nakamoto chose him as his successor at the end of 2010. Gavin became the lead developer of the open-source code that determines how Bitcoin works and whether Bitcoin can survive. The Bitcoin Foundation paid more than $200,000 worth of Bitcoin for his contribution. He has fulfilled it many times.
7. Roger Ver
Also known as Bitcoin Jesus, he was one of the first Bitcoin billionaires and was said to hold at least 100,000 Bitcoins. The famous libertarian dropped out of college to focus on his Bitcoin-related projects. Unlike other billionaires, he spends his cash on private islands and airplanes.

But there are still a few universal indications of wealth.' , content: 'By Libby Kane
“Rich” is relative.
Maybe you think it means being in the top 1% of earners in some of the wealthiest cities in the US. Maybe it means being able to buy a flashy mansion or spend your life flitting from luxury vacation to luxury vacation.
But former investment banker Kristin Addis told Insider she feels richer earning about 40% of her previous six-figure salary while she travels the world. Nick and Dariece Swift, who also left their jobs to make a fraction of their former income, said they’re happier earning less. The self-made millionaire stars of “West Texas Investor’s Club” say their relationships are more valuable than the money they earn.
Ultimately, “rich” can be just as subjective as “happy” — it’s different for everyone. However, there are a few universal indications of wealth, no matter how you view it.
1. You can save money
“Most people fail to realize that in life, it’s not how much money you make. It’s how much money you keep,” writes Robert Kiyosaki in “Rich Dad Poor Dad.”
At the end of the day, money does not solve financial problems — in fact, it often exacerbates them. Consider the lottery winners who lost it all within a few years, or the professional athletes who made millions in their 20s and wound up broke.
“Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws, putting a spotlight on what we don’t know,” says Kiyosaki. “That is why, all too often, a person who comes into a sudden windfall of cash — let’s say an inheritance, a pay raise, or lottery winnings — soon returns to the same financial mess, if not worse, than the mess they were in before.”
If you can hold on to a portion of the money you earn, you’re in good shape.
2. You can live comfortably below your means
Living below your means is one of the major tenets of responsible money management: spending less than you earn, however much that may be.
Self-made billionaire Anthony Hsieh told Insider that learning to live within his means was a lesson he learned from his parents, who immigrated to the US from Taiwan.
The habit “has helped me quite a bit and that’s one of the reasons I’ve survived and flourished in consumer lending for 30 years,” he said. “My career spans four different economic and housing cycles and I’m still sitting at the table as a key executive in consumer lending. I think part of that is my discipline of making certain that the company and myself don’t overspend.”
Living within your means might not sound like a big deal if you’re already doing it, but not everyone can manage. A 2019 report released by GOBankingRates found that a third of Americans surveyed are living paycheck to paycheck.
3. You will eventually be able to pay for the things you really want
If you can go out and buy a yacht in cash today, most people would agree that you’re rich. However, if you can go out and buy that same yacht five years from now after setting a savings goal and socking away money on a monthly or annual basis, guess what? You’re probably still rich.
Survey after survey turns up the same dispiriting result: Americans aren’t saving all that much. The same GOBankingRates survey reported that 45% of respondents had no household savings, and an estimated 40 million households have no retirement savings whatsoever.
Which brings us to our next point …
4. You’re going to be able to afford to retire as planned
Retirement is expensive. Experts say that to live lavishly in retirement, you need to replace about 70%-80% of your current income (although that number is disputed). Even if you’ve downsized, and maybe even relocated to an area with a low cost of living, retirement is still a prolonged period of supporting yourself on little or no income.
Traditionally, “retirement age” is 65, but that’s changing as more Americans find they’re unable to float 20-plus years of living without a paycheck. Data from a 2019 Bureau of Labor Statistics report found that nearly 20% of Americans age 65 and older are still working.
If you can afford to retire when you want to, it’s a luxury.
5. You aren’t motivated purely by money
One common thread you’ll find among self-made millionaires and those who study them is that “rich people” tend to focus on something other than the dollar signs: They’re solving a problem, or following a passion, or striving to build their business as much as possible.
That, right there, is a luxury. If you can’t make ends meet, you can bet you’ll be focusing on the dollar signs over the intellectual fulfillment of your job.
This doesn’t mean you can’t be happy to earn a sizable paycheck or you can’t be excited to watch your investments grow, but money isn’t your chief motivator or source of joy. If you have the luxury to focus on something other than the money, you’re in a good place.
6. You view money as an ally
“Most people have a dysfunctional, adversarial relationship with money,” writes self-made millionaire Steve Siebold. “After all, we are taught that money is scarce — hard to earn and harder to keep. If you want to start attracting money, stop seeing it as your enemy and think of it as one of your greatest allies.”
The reason wealthy people earn more wealth is because they’re not afraid to admit that money can solve most problems, Siebold says: “[The middle class] sees money as a never-ending necessary evil that must be endured as part of life. The world class sees money as the great liberator, and with enough of it, they are able to purchase financial peace of mind.”
If you aren’t scared of money — if you view it as an ally, and a tool that can help you achieve what you want in life — you’re ahead of the game.
7. You aren’t stuck
“What I have realized over time is that in many ways, money spells freedom,” self-made millionaire and NastyGal founder Sophia Amoruso wrote in her book, “#GIRLBOSS.” She continued:
“If you learn to control your finances, you won’t find yourself stuck in jobs, places, or relationships that you hate just because you can’t afford to go elsewhere. … Being in a good spot financially can open up so many doors. Being in a bad spot can slam them in your face."', category: Category.first)

I don’t know you, but I assume that this is one of your goals in life. If I can be so affirmative, it is because a majority of people have this goal. The rise of the Internet has made this even more accessible than before.
Besides, the great successes that make people dream are exposed on the Internet in a way that was not possible before.
As a result, not a day goes by without you reading stories of people who have achieved great financial success. This naturally attracts you, because this is what you want to achieve as well. These stories are often written to show you that anything is possible for you too.
Working hard for a long period of time is essential, but it is not enough to become rich
After all, these people were just like you and me. They are ordinary people who “suddenly” experience extraordinary success.
“Suddenly” is in quotes here, because while this success may seem overnight to those who read these types of stories, it actually takes a lot of effort. In life, nothing is overnight, except for those who patiently build their success for years in advance.
So you will work hard in your field to earn a lot of money and become rich.
Unfortunately, after a few years, you will realize that your work will never make you rich. You may be able to earn enough money to live a comfortable life, but you will never have the financial wealth that you can aspire to.
This is not a popular view, but there are plenty of examples to support it.
Celebrities like Bono and Jay-Z have become immensely wealthy because of the way they have invested the fruits of their labor
You all know Bono, the leader of the band U2. His real name is Paul David Hewson, and today this music star has an estimated fortune of over $700 million. You might think it’s normal for a singer whose band has sold 175 million albums around the world to be so rich.
In reality, it is not at all. Many hugely successful singers have a much smaller fortune than Bono.
If Bono has such a fortune, it is above all because he understood that it is not with his work that he would become rich. By investing the fruit of his work intelligently, he could make it grow. So Bono created an investment company that invested early in Facebook, for example.
With this one investment in Facebook, Bono earned more money than he did with his entire successful professional career.
Bono’s example is far from unique. The rapper Jay-Z has also sold millions of albums. However, more than 90% of his estimated $1 billion fortune comes from his music business. He too has become immensely wealthy by investing the fruits of his labor wisely.
It’s the same with Bill Gates and many others
This is true in other areas.
Bill Gates is known for creating Microsoft. Everyone thinks that his wealth comes from the creation of this computer company whose operating system is ultra dominant in personal computing. Again, this is not the case. 17% of Bill Gates’s fortune comes from his shares in Microsoft.
This is a significant figure, but 83% of his current fortune comes from his investments throughout his career.
A great friend of Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors in history, Bill Gates has always invested his money wisely through his personal holding company “Cascade”. Today, these investments allow him to post a personal fortune of nearly 130 billion dollars.
The examples I have just given you are far from unique. I could list many more, but I think you get the idea.
To become rich, investing the fruits of your labor intelligently is a necessity
It’s not your job that will make you rich. Your goal should be to use the fruits of your labor to make investments that will work for you in the years to come. By making investments that make you money even while you sleep, you will maximize your chances of becoming rich as Warren Buffett once said:
“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.”
Once you’ve invested your money and become rich, you’ll still be seen by others as the same person who works in your original field of expertise.
However, it’s what you do with your money that will allow you to join the ranks of successful people like Bill Gates, Bono, and Jay-Z. Earning money is important, but the key is how you make your money grow through winning investments.

They’re incredibly overvalued by history’s standards', content:'Now is not a good time for growth stocks. They’re incredibly overvalued by history’s standards. While an overvalued stock can become even more overvalued, inflation has put a dent in those plans.
Excessive inflation hurts many stocks, but it hurts growth stocks the hardest. Part of the reason is that growth stocks maintain their frothy valuations because of expected future earnings. Inflation erodes those future earnings and decreases the purchasing power of that money.
Higher inflation eventually translates into higher interest rates which increases the cost of borrowing money. Since growth companies rely on borrowed money to fund their ventures, it’s no wonder growth stocks have been plummeting lately.
While we may have a buy the dip opportunity coming up, sometimes you buy a dip and it keeps on dipping. I believe that can continue happening, especially when certain growth stocks have price-to-sales ratios in the 30s and beyond.
Valuations Matter Again
They’ve been mattering since February. The fact Virgin Galactic is getting beat down this badly since their successful launch to space highlights this truth.
Many growth companies reported incredible earnings in the previous quarter but saw their stock prices plummet nevertheless. I’d do YouTube video after YouTube video explained the same thing about different growth company.
No matter how good the news or earnings, they seemed to tank.
Many growth stocks report their earnings in late July and early August. Earnings reports can create significant upside, but they can also stir up a negative reaction. With valuations mattering again, I’m more pessimistic.
Even blowout earnings can tank a stock with an unjustifiable valuation. That’s why I am heading for the exits.
What I’m Exiting And What I’m Holding
I’m not selling off my entire portfolio and hoarding cash. Certain growth stocks make sense at these prices, and I’m willing to hold onto certain companies.
However, the valuations don’t make sense for each company. Each investor has to make their own decisions. Due to appreciation and my desire to pursue growth, I’ve ended up with some companies that have P/S ratios over 30. I’m shaving off many of those positions.
Depending on what happens next, I may sell off some of my shares with P/S ratios above 25.
I’m holding onto dividend stocks and reasonable valued growth stocks. I don’t believe in selling off an entire portfolio and over panicking. That’s how investors miss out on incredible upside and keep kicking themselves for past mistakes.
But some stocks have become incredibly overvalued. Building up cash in the short term makes it easier to capitalize when stocks become incredibly undervalued.
Asymmetric Risk-Reward Ratios Aplenty
We can all agree that growth stocks have the potential to go up or down 20%+ in a single month for little to no reason. While earnings justifies some of that movement, at other times, the movement has no news behind it.
Given inflation concerns and stretched valuations, there isn’t incredible upside in the short-term. However, there is a large amount of downside.
To risk a 20% drop just on a few extra percentage points is penny wise but pound foolish. Not all stocks present this much potential downside, but we’ve already seen it play out in growth stocks…and many of them are still overvalued.
If we see many of these growth stocks drop 20% or more, the scenario will be reversed. Downside will be limited but there will be plenty of upside. I’d rather sell when the risk-reward isn’t in my favor and return when that situation changes.
These are the reasons I am currently selling off some of my growth stocks. Most of the stocks in my portfolio right now will stay there. However, I’m wary enough to shave off some positions and look at my portfolio more closely.', category: Category.first)

I spent — or misspent — a lot of my twenties, and a fair portion of my thirties — not managing my money very well. I didn’t have my education yet, and that made a big difference, but so did my overall attitude about money. I thought I had time, that life was to be enjoyed in the little things, and that my financial focus should be on my kids. I wouldn’t change my position on that last part, but the rest of it? Well, let’s just say I’ve altered my stance.
When I was younger, not only did I not make very much money, I invested practically nothing, and saved absolutely nothing. It’s not that I didn’t want to. First, I didn’t have it to spare, and second, even if I did have any, I wouldn’t have known how to go about it. My father died when I was just twenty, and my mother, though she never lived in poverty, was not a saver-investor herself, and thus provided me with no guidance whatsoever in setting myself on a financially healthy path.
I hitched my romantic, partnership of a wagon to a teacher who made a modest, but fair, salary and who also hadn’t the foggiest notion about how to budget and prepare for a life of lower stress. Our first house was one we could afford, a modest Cape Cod on a tidy street. Nothing special, just cute and solid, and a perfect little starter home. It was our second house that provided the wakeup call. Far too large, a brick behemoth that sucked us under, it was impossible to heat no matter how we tried and as the economy sputtered we simply couldn’t keep up. We found ourselves flailing until we finally filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy just hoping we could avoid a total loss. (Let me tell you — letting go of the house would have been the better choice.) We held on through the tumult, but it was a financial albatross to put it mildly.
So here I am, having just turned fifty, divorced since my mid-forties, and I’ve learned a lot. I’ve learned what I will — and what I won’t — do to make sure I avoid those financial pitfalls. I may not retire in the lap of luxury thanks to my late start, but that’s okay. I’m making serious headway toward my goals and I’m confident that I’m erasing the errors of a couple of decades of youth without the financial wisdom I have now. So what’s to share?
1. Money spent learning is money well-spent.
I have two master’s degrees, and I’m still considering law school. At fifty. Not a dime that I have spent on my education was misspent. I’d do it again and again. I am sure I am not finished with my education even if I don’t become a lawyer. I’ll get a certification of some sort, add to my training, pile on some skills. It is always, always worth it. Even if I’m buying a book to level-up, it’s totally worth the cost.
2. My house was an amazing investment.
Lots of people, articles, and naysayers will tell you not to buy a house. And they are correct. The market right now is terrible! But… I bought my house at a good interest rate, at a good price, and in a not-so-amazing neighborhood on the edge of a very good neighborhood. Because I have hope and I did my homework. I know that people move, they move in waves, that cities revitalize, that people like parks, and that if nothing else, I will have a piece of something I can make into a rental property if I need to, even if my renters are my grown children. I did not overpay and I have some equity. I know homeownership is not for everyone but it’s for me.
3. I will never marry (or be in a long-term relationship) with someone who has different money values than me.
My goals and values have become an essential part of who I am. I can’t imagine now being with someone who thinks it’s okay to splurge-buy, even though I’m no miser. I buy quality items with the plan of only purchasing things once. I wait for the things I want, I don’t get so excited about having the latest-greatest like I used to. I’m not an early-adopter. I don’t want to have a partner who is any of those things, either. I’d rather save for three years and travel to India than take a yearly trip to Ocean City, ya know?
4. I’m not quite a true minimalist, but almost. And it’s great.
I don’t have a lot of stuff. I used to think that possessions equaled wealth, and that accumulating things that people would see meant that they would know I was doing okay. Now? I know the opposite. I live a pared-down life, I comment frequently that my slim life is easier to track, and that my kids will have an easier time cleaning out my house when I’m gone. My ex-husband was even worse about accumulating things, mementoes, and keepsakes, and it meant that we were a household of useless trinkets which felt awful when all of that had to be filtered through when we separated, divorced, and moved. So much of it was just discarded, given to charity and thrown away.
5. I invest for the future — my own and my children’s.
My kids are adults, but I still save for their sakes. And, of course, mine. I invest whatever I can, and usually that’s quite a bit now, because I know that it’s worth it. I want my kids, and maybe grandkids, to have a bit of something I didn’t have. A trip, maybe, or a semester’s worth of tuition, or the opportunity to pay off a loan early. I did some simple things, like set up an automatic ten-dollar per week automatic investment in my 401k. It might not sound like much, but that is in addition to the 4% of my paycheck that my employer puts in and the 4% I put in, and so it just goes there. I started an Acorns account AND a Betterment account, just because they are different brokerages, and I can handle them differently, with different amounts of risk (and reward). I have money in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Diversity, yo. So the asset that is my house, which I maintain very well, and the diversity of my investments, both stock and savings, means that I am looking toward a decent future. I got started late, but hopefully not too late, and my approach is wise (enough).
I don’t seek money purely by going after jobs with huge paychecks, although I did level-up my skills and income by getting advanced degrees and I sharpen my resume like a razor. I combine whatever I can to have a financially solid mid-life and beyond. I hope very much not to be a little old lady shacking up with my grown children, but if I do, it will be because they want me to be the cool grandma taking their kids to the mall, not because I am avoiding eating cat food out of necessity.
Live life large, but on a small scale financially, even if you lived a little too much life in your earlier years, and I think all will be well. At least, I’ll let you know when I turn 70!', category: Category.first)

You don’t have to be wealthy to be good with money.
However, a lot of wealthy people are good with money — and it’s how they got to be that way. Millionaires often aren’t living the lifestyle you might think they are. Instead, they’re frugal, and tend to spend only what they can afford. They’re always looking for ways to make their money grow, rather than spend it.
Millionaires or not, there are some purchases that just don’t make sense to anyone who’s good with money. Here are the top seven things they aren’t likely to buy or spend on.
1. They’re not buying brand-new cars
“The person who actually has several hundred thousand in the bank or may even be a millionaire is going to drive a five-year-old car or a 10-year-old car,” says personal finance expert and author Lynnette Khalfani-Cox.
A new car loses 10% of its value in the first month and 20% of its value in the first year, Insider contributor Steven John reports. Someone who’s good with money won’t want to take on that kind of loss.
Those who are good with money know that the best value comes from buying used and that by keeping the same car for a while, they can save a lot.
2. And they’re not leasing new cars, either
When it comes to leasing, Khalfani-Cox says that someone who’s good with money will most likely turn the other way. “They’re not going to say, ‘Oh, let me lease this $50,000 car, and then next year let me lease another one,’” she says.
Leases will still involve down payments, and though the monthly payment and up-front payments may be lower, you’ll never own anything as you could with a loan. Though a lease may seem like a way to dodge debt in the short term, those who are good with money will see it in a different light.
“If you’re motivated by the lowest long-term cost, buying and keeping your cars longer will make more financial sense,” Alain Nana-Sinkam, the vice president of strategic initiatives at TrueCar, previously told Insider’s Tanza Loudenback.
Those who are good with money are likely to be less caught up in needing the latest and greatest, meaning a lease won’t really be the best option for them.
3. They don’t buy houses they can’t afford
Those who are good with money aren’t looking to spend more than they can afford on a home, and they know that the best piece of real estate is the one they can afford.
Insider contributor Holly Johnson saved aggressively to pay off her home by age 40, and she travels for multiple months of the year by spending frugally and leveraging credit card benefits.
And when it came to buying a house, she and her husband bought a significantly smaller house than they could have to pursue early retirement and living mortgage-free. “Housing affordability calculators have always told us we could spend double, triple, or more than we did on a home,” Johnson wrote. “But we have always ignored them and forged our own path.”
If they’d bought a larger house, “we would have a lot less money to save and invest each month toward early retirement. We would also have to drastically curb our annual travel budget.”
4. They’re not buying things on credit that they can’t pay for
Whether it’s a $2,000 purchase or a $20 purchase, those who are good with money won’t pay interest on their purchases.
Carrying a balance on your credit card means you’ll be charged interest every month, and it won’t be cheap, either — many credit cards will charge interest rates of 25% or more.
Insider writer Elizabeth Aldrich racked up $10,000 worth of debt in her 20s. But, since then, she’s learned from her past and has become good with money, paying it all off in three years and building a $20,000 emergency fund in six months.
As she looked back on the money mistakes that got her into debt, she cites carrying a credit-card balance as one of the biggest issues. “Every month I would run up a balance on my credit card and then pay off what I could by the end of the month,” she wrote. This habit caused her to “spend thousands of dollars on credit card interest in my 20s.”
Now, she never spends money on interest.
5. They’re not buying luxury goods from brand-name designers
Those who are good with money are “less interested in brand names or tags and labels,” says Khalfani-Cox.
As Insider’s Hillary Hoffower reports, “Showing off wealth is no longer the way to signify having wealth. In the US particularly, the top 1% have been spending less on material goods since 2007.”
Instead of material items, many wealthy people these days are opting to spend on privacy, exclusive wellness and fitness routines, and investing in education instead of buying designer items.
6. They’re less likely to load up on material items at all, opting for quality over quantity
Those who are good with money aren’t filling their closets with fast-fashion clothing and buying an abundance of cheap things that will break. Instead, they’d rather put money into items that will last.
“They’re more concerned with quality as opposed to quantity,” Khalfani-Cox says. “I think people who are good with money are often not afraid to go against the grain and to actively unplug from consumerism.”
7. They probably aren’t planning lavish, expensive weddings
Anyone who has planned a wedding knows just how costly they can be. But those who are good with money aren’t planning to spend lots of money on their big day
Nathan Clarke of The Millionaire Dojo used aggressive savings techniques and investments to sock away over $100,000 in savings by age 25, and he has hopes of becoming financially independent and is pursuing his goals of becoming a millionaire.
For him and his now-wife, one of the things that helped them reach $100,000 in savings was a low-cost wedding. They spent just $10,000 on the big day and saved aggressively.
“Really, all we paid for was all the decorations, food, and a little bit for the reception venue,” Clarke wrote. “I don’t understand why people think they have to spend $50,000 on a wedding. I’d rather travel the world for a year with $50,000 than spend it on one day.”

(Subscribe on Apple Podcasts and Spotify!) Tim and I grew up in Central Illinois obsessed with “Siskel & Ebert,” and the podcast is meant to be just like that show: Two Midwestern dopes who see way too many movies and love nothing more than to talk about them with each other.
Ever since 1991 — when I was 16 years old — we, at the end of the movie year, announce our Top 10 Movies of the Year to each other, a podcast tradition that is now known as “Dorkfest.” But at the midway point of the year, which, as you might have noticed, just passed, we give our six best films of the first six months. It’s a way to point out movies that people might have missed, and make sure we don’t forget them when the movie year ends.
We did this show two weeks ago, right before Grierson left for the Cannes Film Festival. (He saw some great movies there: Here’s his ranking of every movie he screened.) It occurred to me that, other than that podcast, I had not actually listed my six best films of the year so far anywhere. So this seems like the right place for it.
Before I list, though, I must say: It has been truly glorious to be back in movie theaters again. Everyone has their own risk tolerance, but going to the movies was basically the first thing I wanted to do when I was fully vaccinated. I’d missed it terribly. Going to the movies has always been a place of peace for me, a refuge I can enter where, for two-or-three hours, my own world peels away and I get to go somewhere else entirely. Ebert once wrote, about the first time he saw Star Wars, that “my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it’s up there on the screen. In a curious sense, the events in the movie seem real, and I seem to be a part of them.” This is what the best movies do for me. They transport me to another universe, another life, entirely. I like the life I have; movies are not a place to escape from some torment or pain. But movies expand the limits of my imagination. They allow me, for a while, to be something else.
It’s so good to have them back. Here are the best six movies I’ve seen this year so far.

A Glitch in the Matrix, directed by Rodney Ascher
The director of the terrific documentaries Room 237 (about fans’ theories about The Shining) and The Nightmare (about people who have living nightmares) looks at the theory that we all live in a simulation, and the people who desperately believe it. I wrote about this movie here and like it even more now. Ascher’s movies are not about the theories: They’re about the people who believes them so passionately. And the movie, made during the pandemic, looks terrific. (Available for streaming on Hulu.)

In the Heights, directed by Jon M. Chu
It does not reach the glorious peaks of Hamilton, but Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical is a joyous, sometimes downright euphoric explosion of energy and good cheer. Chu expands the canvas and makes the musical numbers feel both real and fantastical. It is impossible for this to not put you in a good mood. (Available for streaming on HBO Max on July 30.)

A Quiet Place, Part II, directed by John Krasinski
Stronger, more focused and more expertly directed than the first film, A Quiet Place Part II is a thrilling, almost insanely tense sequel that expands the canvas but doesn’t lose the claustrophobic thrill. This remains a terrific idea for a movie and works even better the second time. Definitely see it in a theater if you can. (Available only in theaters.)

Saint Maud, directed by Rose Glass
A horror film like few others, Saint Maud is first and foremost a character study about a woman who is falling apart but still trying to hang on. The movie is terrifying, but in a much more interesting way than you’d think. And the ending is an absolute killer. (Available for streaming on Hulu.)

Summer of Soul, directed by Questlove
A fantastic concert film about the 1969 Harlem Music Festival, informed by a director who is equal parts fascinated by the actual rapture of music and eager to embrace the world, and the people in it, with big huge open arms. See it on a big screen, if you can, but if you watch it home, make sure to play it loud. (Available for streaming on Hulu.)

Zola, directed by Janicza Bravo
Famously based on a Twitter thread, Zola is a wild, energetic fever dream that’s absolutely intoxicating to watch. It has the wit, cleverness and playfulness of early Tarantino: At times, it feels like the next generation version, a director getting high on their own supply. It’s electrifying. (Available in theaters only.)
Apologies to the equally wonderful The Mitchells Vs. the Machines and Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, both of which just missed this list. Go see some movies, people. They’re good for the soul.

I even went so far as to write a screenplay, though it was radically different from anything we’ve seen on screen in the Purge series. For one thing, it had more of an oppressive religious angle and was set amid a Puritanical cult, who repress all their sinful urges to an absurd degree, except for one day in the year when all sin (including murder) is permitted. I went so far as to get feedback on this screenplay and polished it up into fairly good shape.
Alas, you snooze you lose. I didn’t take the project further, and a few years down the line, The Purge pipped me to the post. Oh well. No sense in begrudging the success of the franchise, even though they have varied greatly in quality, to say the least. However the latest instalment, The Forever Purge, I liked more than usual. It takes the premise a little further, with ominous warnings of how the Purge doesn’t purge anything, but rather spreads like a contagion, and eventually won’t be contained to just one night.
Sure enough, a Mexican immigrant couple working at a Texas stables get caught up with the aftermath of the Purge, as a nationwide cult of organised rebels decides to continue the murderous mayhem after it officially finishes, to “cleanse” the country of undesirables (principally immigrants). Said couple are Juan (Tenoch Huerta) and Adela (Ana de la Reguera, who initially find themselves at the wrong end of Juan’s racist employer Dylan (Josh Lucas) before they are forced to work together to try and escape to Mexico. Yes, Mexico — see the irony? It’s not exactly subtle, nor particularly original (Roland Emmerich’s The Day After Tomorrow pulled a similar stunt with people rushing across the Mexican border from America in a ha-ha-how-ironic moment).
On the other hand, performances are good enough, and there is plenty of nasty gruesome violence to satisfy genre fans. Director Everardo Gout isn’t great at handling the frightening aspects, throwing out a bunch of jump scares that fail to scare. On the other hand, there are some intermittently exciting action sequences.
It would be easy to snootily dismiss The Forever Purge as satire for nitwits, but sometimes blunt instruments are effective. In this case, the lingering unpleasantness of the Capitol riots provides obvious but powerful parallels. Although the film is clearly preposterous, with America more polarised than ever, perhaps the Mad Max-style landscapes seen here aren’t such a huge leap from reality. Let’s just hope they don’t become reality. In the meantime, The Forever Purge does just enough to engage horror audiences.', category: Category.second)

Siegler', url: 'https://500ish.com/the-hidden-black-widow-5016822a84f4', image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*RmNi87vECfpWG5_zdRHHCQ.jpeg', description: 'The reviews were good.', content:'The reviews were good. There’s huge pent-up demand. And it’s Marvel. So no surprise that Black Widow performed well both at the Box Office and at home this weekend. The fact that Disney is touting the latter with an actual number — which they have not done previously — says a lot. In Crocodile Dundee fashion: “That’s not a streaming service. That’s a streaming service.”
It is hard to imagine any of the other streaming services pulling an additional $60M out of customers’ pockets, on top of the money you’re already paying Disney for Disney+. But that’s the power of their IP and the narrative universe they’ve woven around it. The $158M ($80M domestic, $78M overseas — notably, without China) at the Box Office is just the cherry on top. Albeit a huge fucking vaccinated cherry in a world still grappling with a pandemic.
Anyway, this is less about the future of cinema — I’ve talked about that enough here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here — and more about this very specific way Disney has set up their hybrid theatrical/streaming model. Because the most impressive thing is actually the $60M despite a few massive hoops which some users, including myself, had to jump through in order to collectively pay that.
Like clearly many people, I went to sign up for Disney’s “Premier Access” layer on Thursday night ahead of the Black Widow release. Except I couldn’t seem to do that on my Apple TV Disney+ app. Because of course I couldn’t, what was I thinking?! There’s no way Disney is going to give Apple a 30% cut on all those sales, so you can’t do it in-app like every other digital good. And because you can’t do it in app, Disney can’t even talk about where you can do it. These are the first two rules of Fight Club, if memory serves.¹
So instead, like millions of other Americans, I had to Google where to actually pay for this on the web. And then that required signing in to my Disney+ account from the web, which meant busting out my password manager. Then busting out my credit card, because I originally bought my subscription elsewhere. And then once I paid to unlock my access, I was set! Except it took a while to propagate back to my Disney+ Apple TV app. What a great movie-going experience. It almost made me long for an AMC — almost.
But yeah, that’s the general path many of us had to follow to be able to watch Black Widow this weekend. Click-to-buy, this was not. At best, it was like 40-clicks-to-buy. And still, Disney made $60M from this! It’s really pretty incredible.
Again, it’s a testament to Disney, to Marvel, to the luxury of watching a premium movie at home. $30 feels like a lot of money because it is a lot of money for a single movie, but it’s also roughly the cost of two tickets to see said movie in a theater in some major cities, such as San Francisco.
The difference is that Disney gets to keep a lot more of that money when they don’t have to give half of it to a movie theater. But only if they also don’t have to pay 30% to Apple. Which is why the silly hoops.
And it’s fine. But what’s not is the fact that it’s just really a pretty shitty experience as a consumer to buy this content. Disney and Apple, as two consumer and product-centric companies should be ashamed of it. And honestly, Apple especially for the bullshit nonsense that you can’t even tell the customer where to go to get the content. What a joke.
They should win by offering the best payment experience and getting Disney to use it through amazing conversion and/or customer love. Not by complete and utter obfuscation.', time: 4, category: Category.second)

He’s ragged, physically deformed, but still standing. Come boxing, alcohol and drug abuse, mental demons, and more than a decade of loneliness, nothing could knock out the once sexiest actor on the planet.
But, to get to the level of self-knowledge Rourke has at 68 years old, you have to be willing to change. You have to forget all about the tough-guy crap, toxic masculinity, and macho swagger that rule your mind. You need to open yourself up and be vulnerable — ultimately, that’s what saved Mickey. He had to walk through living hell and come out the other side with a heart that still beats.
Rourke’s journey in Hollywood has been a long one. He’s gone from a nobody to one of the biggest names in Hollywood, then back to a nobody. He’s an employable actor today, but nowhere near as big he once was. He’s gone through a path of physical, mental, and emotional transformation that is rueful and hardly survivable. If it doesn’t kill you, it’ll leave a mark you’ll carry for the rest of your life.
In Hollywood, no one would survive that but Mickey Rourke.
Rourke was born in New York in 1952 and came from nothing. His father left his family when he was six years old. Soon after, Rourke’s mother remarried a Miami Beach police officer named Eugene Addis, who moved the family to South Florida. Mickey claims that Addis repeatedly abused him and his brother, Joey, growing up. That’s when the first seed of an everlasting sense of shame was planted in his mind.
It has taken his whole lifetime to forgive himself for not standing up against the man he was forced to call “Daddy.”
He took up boxing when he was twelve to learn how to defend himself − to be able to stand up against the big and mean stepfather. It toughened him up. It was a response to all the abuse he had to endure as a child. Young Mickey felt responsible for his brother and wanted to protect him, too. But, he was only a seven-year-old kid who had to give in to his brutal stepfather. He confessed in an interview, “I had a lot of shame. I thought it was manlier to take that shame out in anger. So I took it out on everyone else. It began before my acting.”
Asa teen, Rourke had twenty-six fights and won twenty, seventeen by knockouts. That gave him status and respect. However, his boxing career was cut short after he suffered multiple concussions. The damage was so severe, they wouldn’t let him fight anymore.
He turned to acting by chance. A friend of his at the University of Miami told him about a play he was directing, Deathwatch by Jean Genet, and how the guy for the role of Green Eyes had dropped out. Rourke got the part and fell in love with acting.
After that, he went to New York and worked low-paying jobs for years while he took acting lessons. For his first audition in the Actors Studio, he played a father-son scene, which led to Elia Kazan (one of the founders) say that it was the best audition piece he’d seen in 30 years.
Years later, Mickey explained in an interview, “I liked that you could escape who you were and be someone else, someone smarter, tougher.”
After becoming a young movie star, Mickey never smiled fully in his early films. He had lost some teeth when he was a child and only smiled with his mouth closed. But, his raw talent and presence were so powerful, they gained him immediate fame and admiration.
Acting helped him fill up the space the lack of boxing left. It gave him status and respect again, big paychecks and popularity, but there was no denying how insecure he was. He put on an act to demonstrate he was bigger than life. He often fought on the streets, got arrested for assault against his then-wife Carré Otis, and once was charged with resisting arrest. “I didn’t want to answer to anybody. I lived a nomadic life.” — he said.
He was dangerous, irresponsible, and unpredictable. “I resented all the money, the way people treated me in a special way. I didn’t know how to play the game. I became arrogant and self-destructive. I fought everyone ’cause I thought that was a kind of strength, but it became my weakness.”
Those traits didn’t help him stay in the film business for too long.
By the mid-1990s, Rourke had lost his spirit and despised Hollywood for what it really was: business. He abandoned acting and turned to physical self-destruction. At that point, Hollywood was done with him. He was destructive, abusive, and impossible to work with. Alan Parker, the director of Angel Heart, said that “Working with Mickey is a nightmare. He is very dangerous on set because you never know what he is going to do.” The roles he has taken was strictly for the money, and it showed. He burned the bridges that tied him to find quality work in mainstream cinema.
    In1991, Rourke pretty much gave up on acting and went back to finish what he started as a teen: boxing. He was 39 years old, a burn-out Hollywood prodigy, when he had his first professional match against an auto-mechanic. He wanted to give a last chance for the sport, to test himself physically, while he still had some time to do it.
    The tough guy Mickey wished to become since he was a child, finally had a chance to truly come to the surface. He lashed out in his personal life, steadily losing control. He was drinking excessively, became a heroin addict, and hung out with mob figures like John Gotti. He continued to fight in the ring, hoping that somewhere along the way he’d find himself. In a 2008 interview with the New York Times, Mickey said, “I’d be less of a man if I didn’t react violently to the war in my head.”
    In 1994, Rourke was told by advisers and doctors, if he didn’t want to risk permanent brain damage, he needed to retire. So, even though he never got his dream fight for the world title, that’s what he did. Mentally, those few years of boxing helped him, he claims, but once he hung up the gloves, his body and face were destroyed.
    “I had my nose broken twice. I had five operations on my nose and one on a smashed cheekbone. I had to have cartilage taken from my ear to rebuild my nose and a couple of operations to scrape out the cartilage because the scar tissue wasn’t healing properly. That was one of the most painful operations, but the worst was hemorrhoids.” − Mickey Rourke
    Left with no other option, Mickey decided to return to acting. But, having been dismantled physically and with a terrible reputation in the film industry, he couldn’t expect a warm welcome from Hollywood.
    Tofix his deformations, he underwent several plastic surgeries but chose the “wrong guy.” His once handsome, boyish face turned swollen, unnatural, and unrecognizable. That only added to other personal struggles and deepened his life-long sense of shame and insecurity.
    In 1998, Carré Otis, the love of his life, divorced him after six years of tumultuous marriage. Mickey said that was the last straw and the beginning of a twelve-year period spent in loneliness, which almost killed him.
    He recalled in an interview that the three most important people in his life − his brother, grandmother, and ex-wife − were no longer there. He said, “I had no real friends. I saw a few girls, Russian strippers mostly, but I wasn’t looking for a girlfriend. My wife’s name was tattooed on my arm. I was quite shocked to learn that I was O.K. with being alone. I still am today.”
    It was time for self-reflection and mental healing.
    Although Rourke managed to play small supporting roles in various films during the 90s, his mental and emotional state was a wreck. One day, he looked in the mirror and saw himself the way others have seen him. “I saw the armor, and I scared the f*** out of myself. Instead of going to a therapist, it would have been easier just to go to a priest, leave some s*** out, then have him tell me to say some Hail Marys and Our Fathers, and that’s that!” He knew he needed help.
    At first, he did go to a priest. The two sat down in a basement, smoked cigarettes, drank wine, and prayed together. He admitted, “he stopped me from blowing my brains out.” However, Rourke knew it wasn’t a substitute for actually seeking professional help.
    When Mickey finally attended therapy, he opened up and learned to embrace vulnerability. “I needed a shrink too, so I forced myself to go. I had to learn not to let people push my buttons, find out what was triggering all this rage, and stop throwing things away.”
    All the anger, shame, and sorrow he contained for decades had burst out of him. For the first time, he was mature enough to understand the negative emotions and harmful behavioral patterns that crippled him throughout his life. He put a leash on the pit bull that was out of control inside him. “I’ve barely missed a therapy session in over a decade, and that takes willpower.”
    As a proof of his development, he shared an anecdote in a 2008 interview. He was sitting in a London strip club when a drunk guy got up to his face about his dogs. He said, “I asked him to be nice. I stood up, but I didn’t do anything. In earlier years, I would have done him in. It’s not easy not to react, but I work on it all the time. Every day, I have to remind myself to keep on that road.”
    His long self-improvement resulted in better opportunities in his career, too. After a mesmerizing performance in Robert Rodriguez’s Sin City, Rourke seemed to have found his identity as an actor again. Three years later, he earned his comeback in the leading role of The Wrestler. Darren Aronofsky was willing to give him a chance in a movie that resembled every wrong step he has ever taken in his life and career.
    The role of Randy “The Ram” Robinson was nearly an autobiography. At 58 years of age, Rourke was willing to explore the dark places he avoided for years. His performance was subtle, exempt from any loud quirk, and brought him a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination.
    It seemed he had found redemption at last and was ready to start all over again. After The Wrestler’s success, he had been offered promising chances in mainstream cinema again − but that was too good to be true.
    He slammed Marvel, saying that most of his performance, as villain Ivan Vanko, in Iron Man 2 was left on the cutting room’s floor. He similarly disowned most of his other roles in films like 13 and Passion Play. He said that his role in The Expendables was only a favor for Sylvester Stallone. It didn’t take long until Hollywood banished him once again from any major motion picture.
    Rourke has remained one of the last species in Hollywood who’d never compromise. Not because he was too proud, arrogant, or ungrateful. It’s because he accepted himself fully, and that included never giving in to the industry − not on the cost of his principles.
    Now, he’s more human and sincere than he’s ever been before. Behind his disfigured looks that resemble Mike Myers’ terrifying mask in Halloween, Mickey has finally learned how to own his life decisions − to accept every mistake that eventually led him to where he is.
    He stayed tough as nails but learned how to put that aside when honesty was needed to release the pain that would otherwise suffocate him. He realized, even for a macho man, that there is no shame in vulnerability.
    If you can still bear looking at this actor-monster, you’ll discover the most human being that Hollywood tried to destroy for decades − unsuccessfully.

I still passively watch it when it’s randomly on TV, anticipating its beats and quotable lines. I saw the musical when it came through my city. I am not here to “cancel” a 17-year-old beloved movie. But what I have found in repeat viewings, within a new cultural context, is something curious — the movie never attempts to reckon with why these girls are so mean in the first place. And as someone who was also in high school in 2004, I can tell you, it was likely the weight of the patriarchy, and that meanness is simply misplaced anger that didn’t have anywhere else to go.
Of course, you can’t address all things in 90 minutes. The movie is based on the 2002 Rosalind Wiseman book Queen Bees and Wannabes, which I also read and which also keeps the focus mostly on the girls. Yes, there are snippets of this daily harassment in the movie — Jason asking Cady (Lindsay Lohan) if she wants her muffin buttered (a made-up-for-the-movie innuendo), Kevin G’s lewd focus on Janis’ body (which is later rewarded), and Coach Carr’s black and white thinking when it comes to sexual activity (“you will get chlamydia…and die”) while engaging in the hypocritical illegal abuse of underage girls (fetishizing Asian women in the process…I never said Tina Fey wasn’t without her flaws).
But other than that, the guys are just kinda…there. Maybe this was your experience in high school, but it’s tame compared to mine.
I also went to a wealthy Chicago-area high school like the one depicted in the movie. Guys made inappropriate comments to and about girls in the hallways literally all the time (among those in my memory, directives to “get your wang mouthified” and references to “fish markets”), in front of teachers and hall monitors who were ill-equipped to respond. And forget physical boundaries — I had my legs and butt grabbed without my consent in classrooms.
If a girl dared wear a thong and it dared poke out above her low rise jeans (these were the fashions and we were all guilty), rumors spread like wildfire. And godforbid if you engaged in any consensual sexual activity — even the “good guys,” and some girls — would judge you.
To be a girl in this era was impossible — don’t be sexual, but if you aren’t, you’re a prude. Or, be sexual, but don’t do anything sexual. And if anything nonconsensual happens to you? Well you clearly were asking for it, dressed that way. Or you weren’t dressed that way, so clearly you needed it, prude that you are. At one point in the movie, Tina Fey’s character remarks, “You’ve got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it okay for guys to call you sluts and whores.” As if the girls were the ones to start it.
The girls aren’t mean, they’re enraged.
This is the low hum of sexism that is missing in the movie. These boys in my high school life saw no consequences, and from what I can glean from social media, are thriving — as lawyers, in tech careers, and other professions of influence. These are the boys who become the Brett Kavanaughs of the world.
The girls who encountered them aren’t mean, they’re enraged. The imbalanced power dynamic doesn’t allow them to seek appropriate justice — think of Tim Meadows’ character telling the girls to act more like “ladies” — so they turned that rage toward an easier target: each other.
Here’s my confession: I was at times (as many of us were) a mean girl. I bullied and was bullied, and I know now, from the maturity that comes from the passage of time and various self-help methods, that this behavior stems from being in an abusive dynamic beyond your control.
So let’s look at Regina.
The problem with dismissing Regina as merely a “mean girl” is that it’s framed as if it’s a choice, and not the way she had been taught to be seen.
Her mother, played expertly by Amy Poehler, lives vicariously through her daughter. We know this woman married rich and is clinging to her youth, boob job aside (after all, she’s not a regular mom, but a cool one), trying to embed herself within her daughter’s clique and worried more about coming off as their friend than an authority figure (because if you drink, she’d rather you do it in the house). She doesn’t question the cultural focus on exploiting women’s sexuality — we see, and laugh at, her youngest daughter inappropriately mimicking “Girls Gone Wild” commercials and the “Milkshake” music video; and she celebrates Regina dressing as a Playboy bunny for Halloween and dancing in a “sexy Santa” outfit at the holiday talent show (another confession: I wore a similar outfit as part of my high school dance team) — likely because her sexuality was the main tool she used to secure the life she has, and she’s teaching her daughters to follow suit. This is, she knows, the way you fit comfortably in a man’s world. Indeed, when Janis plans to bring Regina down, she focuses on ruining her relationship, her body and her friendships (referred to as an “army of skanks”), in that order — if you don’t have a man, at least you can be hot enough to get another one, and failing that, at least you have other girls you can have power over and manipulate. The problem with dismissing Regina as merely a “mean girl” is that it’s framed as if it’s a choice, and not the way she had been taught to be seen.
I’d also be curious if Regina’s queer panic/decimation of her friendship with Janis had anything to do with the politics she witnessed in her home (unless we think it’s believable someone who wears a Juicy Couture sweat suit was an early LGBTQ rights activist). We know from recent events how common it is for uncomfortable white women to feel entitled to police other people’s behavior if they threaten the cis white hetero able-bodied status quo — aka, their positioning as the status quo. And clearly this broken friendship deeply affected both parties, with Janis still bitter about it years later. Anger often covers up a deep wounding. So we applaud when we see a reformed Regina channeling her aggression into field hockey. For those who don’t find a healthy outlet for their anger? Who still need to make someone else feel worse to make themselves feel better and more powerful? Well, you can find them in the latest viral social media video, calling the police on a person of color.
Entertaining as Mean Girls is, the villain of the movie is actually not Regina, but a culture that pits women against each other, just as today’s adult mean girls are told the real enemy is anyone who doesn’t look and act like them so they’re distracted from focusing on the real enemy: white supremacist patriarchy.', category: Category.second)

I’ve worked on some really wonderful productions and I’ve been on some really awful productions that if I could get in my TARDIS, travel back in time, and change that timeline — then I would.
But it’s the ‘fun’ that keeps us coming back time after time: The incredible sense of accomplishment that comes on completing the first draft of a screenplay: printing it out and holding it in your hands! Completing everything on the call sheet on a tough shoot and seeing it’s still ten minutes before WRAP! Watching an actor and crew nail a really complicated or emotional scene. Or that amazing feeling when you say CUT for the last time on a feature film! Even the worst shoots provide us with endless anecdotes, and how quickly we forget the bad days.
But the fun bits come from a lot of tedious and non-fun bits. Many filmmakers don’t want to do the boring bits, but understanding and doing these non-fun bits will increase the actual fun when you get to it: give you less stress, fewer nightmares, less stomach tightening phone calls from accountants and lawyers, and ultimately a better and more sellable movie. I’ve made a lot of movies. I started off as a Runner and worked my way up. I worked on 13 movies as a 1 st AC & 2 nd AC and Director of Photography before I became an award-winning Director & Writer in my own right. Having gone from Runner to director I have experienced the whole gauntlet of film making from the biggest shoots ( Harry Potter and James Bond) to tiny micro-budget one-man crew shoots. I have seen many ways to do things effectively and simply.
    Here are some tips to help smooth along your next production. These are my observations from more than 1,000 days on set and 29 years in the industry! Hopefully, they will make your filmmaking journey more fun and more productive.
    There are 6 main areas of filmmaking for the indie filmmaker: Development, Pre-production, production, post-production, festivals, and sales. There are whole blogs, books, and courses on each of these, so for further elucidation please absorb all the info that is out there — these are 32 tips I hope are of use.
    General Tips
Tip #1: Filmmaking always take longer than you think it will. Even if you have a deadline, then you’ll re-edit it later on (George Lucas knows what I’m talking about)
Tip #2: If it’s not fun something has gone wrong. There will be stress and complications but ultimately you should look forward to every day.
Tip #3: There is no right path to success: luck and timing play a huge part. If you have connections or know anyone famous, then use/ask them.
Tip #4: You may meet some dreadful people: trust your gut: if they seem awful they probably are. Ask yourself: do you want to sit next to them on a 10-hour flight? Or hang out with them for six weeks on set?
Tip#5: Filmmaking is really hard. The benefits are few and there is no holiday pay. There will be times when you might get depressed, stressed, and lonely. Recognize these times and if they happen reach out to your friends and colleagues. We all understand. We are here for you.
Tip #6: ask yourself why EXACTLY you are making this movie? Is it for a showreel? Is it to practice, is it because you found a bag with a million dollars in it? Knowing why you are making a movie is a really good help in getting it right. Just wanting to make one, you know, because, is not really enough. Development:
Development is all about getting your idea into a wonderful completed script, and getting that script ready to shoot.
I have met countless filmmakers who tell me they are working on a script and that they have done 50 pages etc. That is great and wonderful and well done you — but what is really great is finishing a script and having it ready to go.
There are tons of blogs, books, and podcasts about writing screenplays — so I won’t go into the “How” of it right now, just a few tips on how to make it less difficult.
Tip #7: Set a deadline. It is hugely helpful, and just like running a marathon, or going on a road trip, if your subconscious knows there is an end then it will carry on ticking over all the time even when you are asleep and your goal will be more likely to be achieved. Choose a date that everyone knows. I usually use Christmas, or my birthday (Early September), or my Dad’s (May) then I have a clear date in my brain I can work towards.
Tip #8: A professional screenwriter can write a screenplay in 6 weeks full time (I once wrote one in 9 days — and it got made). So 6 months is loads of time. Most screenplays are approx 25,000–35,000 words. So break it down, make it easy. Most scenes are 1–2 pages. And if they are longer break them down. Nobody can eat 35,000 weetabix, but you can eat two or three at a go. Make it easy on yourself.
Tip #9: When writing: don’t have a blank page. Psychologically it’s off-putting. I always write a beat sheet, or at the very least a list of notes. And then break them into acts, and fill in the gaps. Then the page is never blank.
Tip #10: If you get stuck on a scene just jump ahead till you find a scene you want to write. It’s a jigsaw puzzle, not a marathon race. Tip #11: Write short character profiles for all your major characters, goodies and baddies, this will help you work out how they behave in any situation. It’ll also help you give each character a voice.
Tip #12: Enjoy it — don’t hate it. Make it fun. Put on music you like, sit in a comfy chair, brew a nice cup of tea. Imagine you are one of the characters how would you do it? How much fun would it be to travel the Amazon, fly in a balloon? Or how terrifying would it be to try to get to an escape pod as an alien is chasing you?
Tip #13: Once you have finished the first draft. Leave it for a least a few days. Then come back to it. Writing is re-writing. Make sure your screenplay is shootable.
Tip #14: once you have a draft you like, read it out loud. Get actors round, organize a Zoom read-through, and read it through. Everything sounds different once you have read it through. And make sure that you are not reading — just listening. Take notes.
Tip #15: Read a lot of scripts. See how the films that win the BAFTAs/Oscars are written and see what they did that you can learn from.
Tip #16: Watch a lot of movies. Obvs.
Tip #17: Start making a list of everyone you know who might be able to help. In any way. Know someone who owns a truck? Put them on the list. Does a relative do catering? Put them on the list. Know someone who owns some land you could film on? Put them on the list. Pre-Production
If you are an indie filmmaker there will almost certainly be no or very little money during this time, and the temptation to only do the fun bits will be huge. There is a reason that The Lord of the Rings (dir: Peter Jackson) movies are rated more highly than The Hobbit and most of it is due to the time spent in pre-production.
Tip #18: schedule as much time as possible for pre-production even if the first few days/weeks are just you and an assistant/producer or anyone.
Tip #19: start phoning the people on the list you made throughout development. Don’t be making that list now.
Tip #20: read your script many times and read the scenes you are going to shoot the night before and sleep on them. Do not undervalue the work your subconscious will do.
Tip #21: visit every location and walk through the possible action in that location. Visualize where the actors will be and where you can put the camera and lighting kit.
Tip #22: think about sound and power. Is it too noisy to film? Can you get electricity to this location or do you need a generator? Are their toilets? Can you park? Where will the Coffee and Tea go? You may think this is not your job, but on an indie film, everything is your job. Tip #23: Don’t get inexperienced runners/Production Assistants/Gophers etc to drive your vans and trucks, just pay for an experienced adult to drive them. If you have a full camera kit it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of camera, dolly, grip kit and you want your 21-year-old next-door neighbor’s kid to drive it, who’s only just passed their test on the 27th try. Sounds like a good idea. This is worth the expense, as your truck will arrive on location on time and you don’t have to worry or fill in an insurance claim.
Tip #24: Talk to all your actors about their roles and see if they have suggestions that make the script better. Good actors will sometimes cut dialogue from a script. Bad actors will always want to add more dialogue.
Tip #25: Actors will always say your script is brilliant and wonderful because they want the gig. Even if your script is awful they will tell you it’s great. Get independent script reports from people who know what they are doing.
Tip #26: If this is your film then you should know the script better than anyone else.
Tip #27: Do paperwork as it comes along. Tedious I know. But Accountants will eventually take over your life if you let them. Pay invoices, check Purchase Orders, and insurance forms as they come in. And READ THE SMALL PRINT. Tip #28: go through every scene and think about how you are going to shoot it. What is the location? Where are the entry and exit points? Where do the actors come and go? Some people do detailed storyboards, some shot lists, and some camera plans (In TV we always do camera plans). Some do nothing at all and wing it on the day. I am a combination of all but mostly I spend time blocking the scenes in my head before I get on set, so as soon as I arrive, I can say: “Camera is over here — looking this way. Actors are here.” And that means immediately everyone can get on with their job and we have wasted the least amount of time.
Tip #29: make sure you have set up all your business requirements properly. Company set up, payroll set up, accountant attached. All of this will bite you in the bum big time later on.
Tip #30: Register your screenplay with a professional body (like the Writers Guild).
Tip #31: hire nice people. Meet everyone you can and see if not only can they do the job but will they be a harmonious fit with the rest of the crew?
Tip #32: Try to get a good night’s sleep before the shoot. I know this can be impossible, so I always have a good book to read on the go, that is nothing to do with the production (try to avoid anything too complicated or Horror that will give you nightmares). I read it before I go to sleep and it helps my brain to spin down and relax.', category: Category.second)

One of them is cybersecurity for you and your team.', content: 'When developing your skills for producing a film or other media, challenges appear, which aren’t connected to your original branch of skills. One of them is cybersecurity for you and your team.
Working on a project about male contraception in December 2019, I noticed how much attention the director was paying to cybersecurity. To write her emails, I needed a special certificate. To communicate via the phone, WhatsApp was a no go, and Telegram or Signal was needed. Fortunately, I already stopped using Dropbox for convenience and switched to Nextcloud.
The movies topic was not sensitive, so I wondered why she puts so much effort into this. Talking with her about it helped me understand the bigger picture.
When we work on projects like a financial conspiracy or child pornography, your phone and communication security is an essential part.
For keeping every team member safe and to secure the production from any outside harm. The important lesson for me is: we should always be aware of security issues, no matter the topic or convenience.
1. What problems can occur, and how you may avoid them.
Your team
Having several team members, you are in part responsible for their safety. This safety can be in danger if certain parties know, that your team member researches a sensitive subject.
As an example, they could be investigating, right-wing party members. If someone detects this together with the personal information of the researcher, your team member could be threatened or attacked.
This can happen from a bad hacker or even the state. Let’s imagine you and your crew research terrorism for an investigative article. A government agency can track your traces, and they will check you. It will be a lot of trouble to explain this afterwards.
A problem, which occurs is hacking. While Hollywood movie scripts are well protected by a lot of paperwork and special rules, the average media production isn’t. Too bad because a script isn’t the only thing that can get stolen. Large sums of money and sensitive data about the crew and cast need to be secured.
Since media production is teamwork, several people have the same access to applications, bank accounts, passwords, and documents. Who has which access and which rights? This should be retraceable.
You‘re using a cloud? Great! Just don’t give everyone, including your intern, access to everything. On a call sheet, you don’t add the actor’s cell numbers, so why take risks inside the production?
To equip computers with security software is clear. One of the best ways to prevent the risks is to make sure software updates on all devices are made regularly.
To secure the internet connection when we are in public places, individual team members use a VPN provider. It’s also helpful to ensure anonymity and avoid tracking.
“The best thing is to develop an interest, You need to want to know how the technology works.” — Bastian Benrath
Communication
In a project, the communication between all team members needs to be safe as well as their rights. It can be a company policy to not use certain platforms out of security issues.
The best example might be WhatsApp. Instead of using it, you can use networks like Telegram or Signal, which are more secure thanks to end-to-end encryption.
“…, do things in person with no devices nearby, or in hard copy, and then we burn the paper.”
Jon Tye, Co-founder of the Whistleblower Aid
Code of security
Everybody needs to be briefed about these topics. What’s helpful is a proper code of security. It should be discussed with all team members and has to be followed by.
The page and the security advices change with time. I might add a part about what browsers and applications we want to use or access to a VPN provider.
All these things need to be discussed and explained to the whole team. Most employment contracts include a part concerning company data. To make a more detailed one who has to be signed after a team meeting about the security, can give extra clearness and safety for all parties.
Don’t push your responsibility away; get everyone in the same boat.
2. Bigger problems, bigger solutions
Learning from bigger players, we see, they might add some extra features.
Whistleblowers
Assume you work in a bigger newspaper. You might work with whistleblowers. It´s the perfect example of what is needed with high profile clients and projects.
If a whistleblower turns to the guardian or the Washington Post, they can use SecureDrop with the Tor network for first communication. SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system news organizations can install to safely and anonymously receive documents and tips from sources.
If you don’t know the Tor Network, shortly it´s a network for anonymous communication. A browser, like every other one. Just secure.
Physical solutions
Jon Tye, the Co-founder of the Whistleblower Aid nonprofit law firm, mentions in an interview with the New York Times that they try to “do things in person with no devices nearby, or in hard copy, and then we burn the paper.” He mentions as well the usage of manual typewriters.
But there are other physical things as well. The burner phone you already know from the Bourne Movies or any other type of criminal film. But how about the Faraday bag? At least I have never heard of it.
They are like an RFID wallet for your electronics. Faraday bags block electromagnetic signals, so your phone, laptop, or tablet can not be connected to Bluetooth, Wlan, 4G, or something else. You can take your electronics with you, but they are not trackable when they are in the bag.
Network
Let’s turn to the last part—your network. If you have a production firm, chances are you have different departments. If so, you might have separate networks, so if someone downloads a virus in the office, the other departments aren’t affected as well.
You can separate your editing suites, offices, and research computers, so one problem doesn’t affect all and causes everyone to stop working.
Conclusion
In the end, the best thing I can do is quoting Bastian Benrath, who said in the Digitec Podcast of the 15th Nov. 2019: “The best thing is to develop an interest, You need to want to know how the technology works.”
I am in no way an expert in this field, I am just interested as well. Keeping yourself updated on cybersecurity is a necessary skill for producing good non-fictional media in the future.

As a result of this, the distribution and broadcasting model that Netflix brought to the industry transformed into a great accomplishment story in a relatively brief time.
Netflix’s business model is based on a model that users can access the entire content library of the platform for a certain monthly fee. Furthermore, Netflix broadcasts its movies on the online platform, without -or limited- a theatrical release. The system, which is very unconventional from the traditional understanding of this Hollywood studio system, has brought great advances in many ways for the viewers, the filmmakers, and the studios. In this sense, we can comfortably say that streaming services like Netflix are shaping the film industry in terms of how we reach movies, what content we consume, and how movies are produced.
With the spread of digital streaming services over the past 10 years, our practices on how we reach the movies have changed drastically. While the interest in Netflix and other video-on-demand platforms from the movie viewers increased, the ratio of those who buy movie tickets started to decline. In 2019, streaming subscriptions were expected to reach $ 46 billion. In contrast, box office revenues were estimated at $ 40 billion. According to a recent study, only 14% of Americans were found to go to the movie theatre frequently.
There are various reasons why viewers favor consuming content from streaming services rather than going to the movies. First, streaming service platforms offer the opportunity to access the entire content library at a movie ticket price, which is a beneficial reason for the viewer. Secondly, digital streaming platforms offer the viewer the convenience to consume content from the device they want, whenever they want. This model forced massive film studios to react. As a result of that, one of the biggest movie studios, Disney has set up its online platform. Moreover, Warner Brothers and other tremendous studios will soon be included in this group.
With the changing relationship between audience and distributor, Netflix has become decisive not only in “how” we access the content but also “what” content we consume. Netflix invests more than $ 150 million annually in algorithms to create a personalized functional recommendation system. With these algorithms, what content we will consume on the platform is no longer completely our decision. In their article, Gomez-Uribe and Hunt suggested that Netflix’s referral system works very effectively thanks to data from millions of users, and this has become a significant factor in popularizing romantic-comedies and thrillers. Platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Apple + reaching more and more users every day. This dominance takes online platforms to a strong position in terms of the content of the movies. Such power can play a decisive role in what should be considered a “well-made movie” in the future.
One of the significant changes in the film industry in recent years is the effects of online streaming services on filmmakers. Netflix’s promise of a freer environment for filmmakers compared to other major studios has led many directors to this platform, which has had significant consequences in the film industry. Additionally, the fact that Netflix has less restrictive rules compared to movie theaters makes Netflix appealing for filmmakers. Another valuable point concerns independent filmmakers. After Hollywood settled in the center of the cinema and the blockbuster films began to dominate the movie theaters since the 1980s, it was challenging to reach wide audiences, especially for independent filmmakers. However, with the online streaming services becoming a major player in the film industry, independent filmmakers had the chance to reach their films to wider audiences. Movie theaters generally prefer big-budget movies because they can profit much more out of it. Therefore, independent films did not find much chance outside of the festivals until now. However, thanks to these digital platforms, such movies have become more accessible to more users.
Nevertheless, for filmmakers, Netflix does not only affect the film industry positively. Many directors argue that the distribution model brought by online streaming services such as Netflix is ​​killing the cinema experience. Recently, Steven Spielberg has suggested that the Netflix format is close to television rather than film, so Netflix films are far from offering a cinematic experience. With the rise of online streaming services, more and more people are beginning to consume movies on their smartphones or computers for practical reasons. These practical reasons began to neglect cinematic experience, which can only be achieved in the movie theater. (You can check BBC’s reflection about the matter in here) These online platforms have created many positive and negative results for filmmakers. In the future, there is no doubt that these digital platforms will have greater reflections for filmmaking and filmmakers.
Since the cinema’s invention, it has been assumed that films belong to movie theaters. However, with this new model, it seems to be the answer to the question of where the movies belong is blurred. What is certain is that with the rise of online streaming services, our movie watching practices have changed and will be changing in the future.

Each year major these major studios piece together projects and fight to be the number one seller at box office. Some studios are consistently number one and consistently have record-breaking opening weekend numbers. What is their secret? The truth is that these big wins are extremely calculated. The studio executives look at more than just the messaging and marketing materials when they begin making a new movie. They also do not wait until they are near launch to start thinking about the films identity and how it fits into the overall brand. No, these are things that are thought of before the picture is put into production.

    Here are some of the best tips you can learn about branding from the film industry:
    
    Hire Great Talent with Their Own Brand
    It is no secret that movies with great actors get bigger budgets, higher ticket sales and better ratings. Part of a script review by the studio is to determine if they have access to the right talent. They spend a lot of time finding the key people to fill the lead role and they do this before they decide on script. Most companies could benefit from this model. Instead of deciding on projects or business ideas, think about whom you will need to fill key roles. Who are they? What have they done? Who do they know?
    
    Hollywood does a great job of bringing on talent that will fill seats, show up for press junkets, and deliver a quality product. Your company can do the same. Look for talent that is affiliated with organizations that you want your brand aligned with. Remember that the people are important. An idea is just an idea unless you can bring it to life and in the right way.
    Timing Is Everything
    The film business is all about timing. You would never see a Marvel movie launch the same weekend as a DC film, and for good reason. The studios are not only looking at the potential competition and their release dates, but they are also trying to be aware of their audience. You wouldn’t release a Christmas movie in January, just like you shouldn’t use Santa Clause in your advertising in February. Being aware of what else is happening in the world and allowing that to impact your timing is imperative. Again, this is something that successful studios have been doing for years.
    
    Know Your Audience
    Another reason Marvel and DC won’t release movies on the same weekend is because they don’t want to cause “superhero fatigue.” As in, they want their audience to be excited for a new superhero movie, not burned out by it. This is a lesson that many brands could take into consideration. Instead of piggy backing off of the success of another brand’s win, work to create a new win that helps prevent exhausting your audience.
    Remember the Budweiser super bowl ad with the puppy? After that ad aired, brands jumped on the puppy train very aggressively. Before you knew it, there were puppies in all of our ads. This is an example of causing fatigue in our audience. There were so many puppy ads that it made other types of advertising standout more, which made those ads more effective.
    
    Appreciate Your People
    At the end of every movie they roll credits. These credits allow for the audience to see the names of each and every person who worked on a film. This is a great way to use the personal networks and brand identity of your employees to help market your brand. People want others to know their work and having a place where they can display the work they have accomplished is a great way to show appreciate for their work. Remember this lesson and find ways to expose the people that work on branding projects at your company. This will be invaluable to them, even if they part ways at some point.
    
    Network and Celebrate People In Your Industry
    The entertainment industry is full of award shows. Everyone in the industry gets some sort of voting right and they vote outside of their companies. These industry awards are given to the best, not the most popular. It is an industry that values working together, appreciating one another and networking. These are things that any industry could obtain. Think about the people in your industry that have done well. How can you celebrate them or let them know that everyone is watching and thinks that they are great. These are the relationships that brilliant careers are built on. So instead of competing, start looking for ways to work together and share your talents.

article20 = Article.create(title: 'Data Analysis Reveals Film Industry Age Bias & Blindspots', author: 'Team Slated', url: 'https://filmonomics.slated.com/film-careers-through-a-data-prism-infographic-c121e0108186', time:8, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*e8BWce6ECE2m2eXB1zKW8g.jpeg', description: 'The latest data analysis conducted by SLATED paints a picture of a cinema business out of touch with its paying public, particularly with regard to the hard-to-reach millennial generation that threatens to defect to alternative forms of entertainment.', content: 'The latest data analysis conducted by SLATED paints a picture of a cinema business out of touch with its paying public, particularly with regard to the hard-to-reach millennial generation that threatens to defect to alternative forms of entertainment. There is a troubling disconnect between the age-groups overwhelmingly favored by the film industry’s greenlighting process and the age-groups that actually perform best in the marketplace based on their films’ return on investment (ROI).
In coming to those conclusions, SLATED’s data team combed through the demographic data of 1,591 feature films that were released theatrically in North America between 2010–15. As part of that analysis, we looked at the ages of the key creative people involved in those releases.
As you can see from the classic bell curve immediately above, mid-career talents in their forties account for the highest volume of films that are seen in movie houses.
Note: the names and faces that you see here to represent each age bracket are based on their ages today; if they worked on films that appear in our data set, then we used their ages at the time of those films’ release dates.
When it comes to age, not all talent categories are treated equally by the film industry. In this cross-sectional analysis, we looked at how lead actors compare with filmmakers.
Each tree ring represents a different age bracket starting with dark blue at the outer edges for those under twenty and extending inward to the dark brown core for those in their late seventies. Corroborating popular perception, lead actors are hired more frequently in their younger years. Directors, on the other hand, are in most demand during their late forties and beyond. The width of each ring corresponds to the number films, percentage-wise, that those talents are deployed at various times during their careers.
In science, the periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations and recurring chemical properties. Applying this concept to the film industry, we arranged all the key creative “elements” in a film according the estimated returns on investment for each age group and talent category.
Film elements at the top of the table are oldest; those on the right hand side are the most profitable. The ROI number is calculated by dividing a film’s worldwide gross (after deducting marketing costs and factoring in tax credits) by its production budget. Note: Gross theatrical revenue is used here, rather than theatrical rentals, because they are a decent proxy for adjusted gross revenue from all sources including TV and video revenues that are not publicly available for this data set.
The underlying trends become much clearer when you separate out those 40 and younger from professionals who are 60 and older.
With the exception of supporting actors aged 26–30, younger professionals tend to be more profitable. Aside from some actors and producers, older professionals tend to be less profitable. Bottom-line: in terms of value for money, youth more often than not trumps experience despite the film industry’s preoccupation with hiring middle-age creative talents.
If profitability is a proxy for audience appeal, then younger filmmaking teams are the ones with their fingers on the pulse. This next chart gauges how well each category performs at different ages.
Any ring that “closes” its performance circle has achieved an ROI level that makes them appealing to investors seeking an “internal rate of return” of 16% or more (see the “greenlight grid” below for more details); the more “open” the circle, the less profitable it is. From these circles, you can see that the industry is missing the mark by focusing so heavily on those aged in their 40s. Producers, represented by the outer purple ring, are the most reliable category of creative talent — a level of consistency borne out in the next chart showing the underlying career trend lines.
When it comes to returns on investment, SLATED’s magic “greenlight” number is 2.8. At that point, SLATED calculates that a film is profitable enough to generate an internal rate of return to investors of around 16% (assuming a 50/50 back end split with producers) — and that’s after a 20% carry to the general partner in a fund. With that target number in mind, we looked at how talent categories perform throughout their professional lives. This is the life-cycle of film careers as seen through an ROI lens.
Here’s another way to contextualize the exact same data. We compared those investment returns with the amount of money that was invested on their films during 2010–2015. The bigger the bubble, the more that was spent. This unprecedented ROI analysis calls into question the film industry’s overwhelming reliance on mid-career filmmaking veterans. By investing so heavily on forty-something talents, the film industry has been turning their backs on younger — and occasionally older — writers, directors, producers and actors who are more reliably profitable.
Tellingly, none of the largest bubbles are green. The film industry also has something of a blind spot when it comes to lead actors in their early thirties — not to mention directors between 26–30, a green bubble so small it is barely visible. That is the age at which Damien Chazelle made “Whiplash”.
The systemic gender bias exposed in our previous infographic extends right across age lines as well. With the exception of 21–25 year-olds, the overwhelming majority of lead roles are given to men even though women of similar ages tend to generate higher returns.
Paradoxically, the age group at which men perform best in terms of ROI (51–55) is also when those actors start getting dramatically fewer roles. In case you are wondering why the ROI for actresses skyrockets when they are in their seventies, look no further than Judi Dench and Emmanuelle Riva. Their respective Oscar nominated roles in “Philomena” and “Amour” pretty much overwhelmed what is a minuscule data set by that age.
Slated’s ROI analysis by age shows that the evaluation methods used by the film industry’s gatekeepers routinely miss the mark in terms of capitalizing on the ebbs and flows of film career cycles. Computer-driven statistical analysis, however, does a much better job at anticipating those peak years and fallow periods — a correlation that underlines how data can be leveraged to stay in sync with audiences by spotlighting age-groups that actually perform best in the marketplace.
If you look at the ROI for both directors and producers at different ages, and compare that to Slated’s corresponding Financial Scores for those ages, you can see that they echo one another fairly consistently. Note: SLATED’s Financial Score, a number from 1–100, indicates a project’s financial prospects. The calculation is based on an assessment of a project’s costs in light of its revenue projections. A Financial Score of “80” roughly equates to an expected ROI of “2.0”.
This age-related film data is thrown into sharper relief when you look at who are buying most of today’s cinema tickets . There is a discernible generation gap between the age demographics of movie audiences and those of the filmmakers and creative teams that entertain them.
The MPAA defines a frequent moviegoer as someone who sees a movie at a cinema once a month or more. If you constructed an average spending pyramid for these avid film fans, as tracked by the MPAA during the years 2010–2015, you would see that 66.2% of tickets sold went to frequent moviegoers under the age of 40. A full 43.4% were twenty-four or younger. Now compare that pyramid with how the film industry allocated its spending over the same period. 66.4% of production budgets was spent on creative talents OVER the age of forty.
The 41–50 age bracket, highlighted here, accounted for nearly two fifths of the industry’s total pie — and yet that same demographic only represented one ninth of all tickets sold to regular customers.
When you consider that so many of this year’s most profitable films at the box office were made by younger filmmakers, you start to question the industry wisdom of investing so heavily on those with established reputations. Particularly since that experience often comes at a financial premium. As the old adage goes: past results do not guarantee future performance. A more prudent approach, for both studios and independent film financiers, would be to build a portfolio across a more diverse range of talents that encompasses both newcomers and veterans. Such a balanced investment strategy s not only backed by actual ROI figures, it also mirrors audience spending patterns across the years.
    Films should be a breathtaking, heart-stopping amusement ride — not the greenlighting process that gets them made. An age-balanced slate of film investments gives you a statistically greater probability of keeping your fingers on that audience pulse. This would not only be better for bottom lines but also for the long-term health of the film industry since cinema history tells us that fresh creative and executive voices have always been the industry’s lifeblood. It is worth remembering that Albert Einstein was himself a millennial when he first rewrote the laws of physics. In the artistic sphere, most of the breakthrough work is done at both ends of the career spectrum, by young geniuses and old masters. If film’s greenlighters crunched their numbers better they might have a better chance of catching more of those lightning bolts of creativity that keep audiences glued to their seats.', category: Category.second)

That’s its burden and its gift. It’s so big and tiny, crowded and empty, foggy and smoky yet bright and shining, and it shakes. If you drive the whole length of the thing, 770 miles from top to bottom, you’re going to need some great driving music. If you’re cool, you’ll blast a playlist of all the newer stuff that I never know about until it’s not hip anymore.
I do get to it, though. I’m a late bloomer and I travel slow, but I catch up eventually.
Recently, I asked some savvy friends for suggestions. I needed a soundtrack to complete a therapeutic assignment: a road trip, no small thing for an agoraphobe like me. I was recovering from a recent flare-up of the anxiety disorder that has crouched and snarled in me for as long as I can remember. I’ve been through this enough to know that I’ve got to do my cognitive behavioral therapy homework (like another program of recovery I’m in, it works if you work it). And I know that good music helps. Great music fixes almost everything.
Over and over again, friends suggested one particular artist, a young woman with increasing critical acclaim. I knew the name.
“I haven’t heard her stuff yet,” I said, and people reacted like — well, you know the face they get when you haven’t seen, eaten, read or smoked the thing they love the most on the planet besides the parent they despise the least? That face.
“Oh my gaaaaaahd,” one friend moaned. “How? How have you missed her? She’s so greaaaaaaaat.”
I said I didn’t doubt she was.
Another friend said, “Her last album is haunting and beautiful. You’ll love it, it’s so you.”
I’m a Scorpio and I’m vain, so I appreciated that.
I said, “Thanks! I just don’t know if I want to be, uh, haunted on a road trip.”
My therapist, who specializes in addiction and anxiety disorders, emphasizes baby steps. I decided I would drive a little less than half the length of the state. I’ll do the whole thing one day, when I’m ready.
I took time off from my job at a charity, a career I am deeply lucky to still have. I booked a contact-free check-in at a relatively isolated spot where I wouldn’t have to talk to anybody. I joined some dating apps in case I changed my mind about talking to anybody. Changing my mind has proven to be a good thing in recent years.
I pointed my car north, on a route that took me through cities and suburbs and endless fields and through the intersection where James Dean smashed a 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder into a 1950 Ford Tudor. They cleared the wreckage a long time ago. There’s a great souvenir shop nearby. In California, there always is.
The whole trip was a dream of golden and green and brown and, at night, twinkling white stars in the broad black sky.
For music, I chose The Chicks, the patron saints of middle-aged white women who are trying their progressive goddamn best to be better. I had recently dyed my hair blond, and I was wearing a plaid red shirt.
The road was gorgeous, and everything was shining. I put on my sunglasses. There are a couple hours like that every evening here, and then there’s the Southern California moment right before sunset they call magic hour. Well, over in Ojai, they call it “the pink moment,” and then they talk to you about ley lines. I lived in Asheville, North Carolina, for two years, I know the speech. It’s better than the one about vaccines.
Later, I switched to Megan Thee Stallion, because Texas women will take you where you need to go and teach you something about yourself along the way. My best friend lives in Houston. Her small daughters think Beyoncé should be president. I do not disagree.
The whole trip was a dream of golden and green and brown and, at night, twinkling white stars in the broad black sky. It was a Chicks hit single about burying a no-good man and not losing any sleep at night. It was a Sturgill Simpson dirge about losing what you thought you wanted. It was an Ennio Morricone soundtrack to some melodramatic frontier romance I’m supposed to have seen. It was not a Megan Thee Stallion banger, but truly her music works in all settings — so you know what, yes, it was that, too.
I should’ve put on the Bruce Springsteen album Western Stars, East Coast energy in pastoral Real-ish America. I love my home state of New Jersey, which is prettier than you think, but delusions and illusions look way better out here.
I used to think North Carolina was the most beautiful state in the country, but with respect to residents of the state I have tattooed on my arm, I have revised my opinion. I always wanted to move to Buncombe County again, but I can safely say I’m not going back to Carolina anytime soon. If you’re lucky enough to live awhile into your own future plans, you get to the revision stage.
Ireached my destination and I was not anxious, not even once. The agoraphobia was way in the rearview mirror, which is where I like it best. I sat around the ranch cottage for a few days and thought about writing but got distracted by a friendly cat and curious wild turkeys and the live oaks and the gleam of the rolling hills.
One day I put on my mask and went to a restaurant, sat on the outdoor patio far from anyone else, and watched the regulars watch a new guy lightly harass the young waitresses. I saw the moment they almost said something and decided not to. He paid his bill and walked off into the night before it got real gross. Everybody started talking shit then. The girls seemed fine.
The night before I left, the people in the cottage adjacent to mine got drunk and fought loudly. They woke me up at 3:30 a.m. For a moment I worried they would hurt each other, and then I thought, “That’s silly. Other people aren’t your responsibility.” This is a thing I have learned in the past couple of years, but I need to remind myself sometimes. Eventually, I fell back to sleep, but for the first time on the trip, I was restless.
I gave the cottage a rave review and wrote a private note to the proprietor about the people who fought, in case they had broken anything. I never heard back. I figured it was her business, but maybe she just didn’t want to deal with all that. Not every woman does, not with everything else we’ve got going on all the time.
I took the long way home, the Pacific Coast Highway. At one scenic stop, there was an overflowing trash can by the railroad tracks and, just beyond, the most beautiful ocean. The breeze was perfect and the stacked refuse looked like a sculpture. I took a photo of it. You can kind of see the ocean in the background.
I got back in the car and, without thinking, put on a perfect album I hadn’t listened to in a very long time.
Some musicians get one perfect album. This guy got a couple, and the many imperfect ones are still excellent. He used to be one of my favorite writers in any genre.
I knew him once, for a little while. He scared me, but not because I thought he would hurt me. I thought he would hurt himself. I wanted to go out with him because I had loved his work for many years and I liked talking to him, but it soon became clear that he was terribly unhappy.
He had the kind of mind that seems forever colorful, fascinating, and unquiet, a party that gets real bad sometimes but always rallies and never, ever stops. He was a genius, too, and I mean that. I’m a good enough writer, sometimes very good, but I know how to recognize a truly great one.
When we started talking, I had just stopped drinking, and your body takes time to adjust. I couldn’t sleep for a month, and I was Very Online at odd hours. So was he, but not because he was sober. I don’t think he’d slept in years. Some vampires don’t need to.
Texts, phone calls, video chats, DMs — there was no pandemic then except loneliness, but our socially distant non-romance worked fine for me.
I reached out privately. I am accessibly pretty, but unintimidatingly so, not the show pony you’d trot out on a red carpet, but the type you might lust after in private because she reminds you of a quirky girl who never talked to you in middle school, the kind of girl you’re too cool for now but haven’t quite gotten over. This buys me a certain amount of access with some types of successful men.
Texts, phone calls, video chats, DMs — there was no pandemic then except loneliness, but our socially distant non-romance worked fine for me. I suppose you could call it a friendship. I wanted to meet up, to go on a date, to get together, but he kept dodging it or backing out. It was confusing, but I was never bored. We never actually met in person, but it felt like something oddly intimate, though not romantic.
“I know you won’t betray me,” he said once, out of nowhere. He said a lot of things out of nowhere. It was part of his charm. “I know you won’t tell anyone about this.”
“About what?” I said. “You just showed me your Star Wars toys, and we talked about books.” He had a lot of first editions. He had a bed that used to belong to a wizard, a real one. He had a suit of armor. I don’t know if he ever wore it. I would’ve worn it every day and ordered really expensive pizza just so I could answer the door that way.
His stories were disjointed, and I didn’t know what was real and what was not. Swords, wands, endless cups, so many coins, princesses or at least the American equivalent, armor and spikes and wet soft vulnerability.
I got the feeling I was on my own life raft, a bit tossed and turned by the waves but overall looking at favorable odds of survival, watching an oddly familiar stranger dance madly on the deck of a ship that was sinking fast. And yet, there were more life rafts, all around, ready and waiting for him.
He could get well if he wanted, I thought. Some people don’t have the money, but he’s got the money. There are doctors. There are places people go.
There were moments when something clear poked out of the hypnotic swirling poisoned mud, some creature that was still and wise and untouched by whatever had happened to him, and I glimpsed the healthy part the rot never reached.
Once he said, “You’re an actual nice person, Sara. You’re a good friend. I’m an asshole. I don’t want to mess you up.”
It sounds like a line, but I could tell he meant it. And then the clear, true thing went back under.
He was lovely sometimes. He was never cruel to me. We don’t stick around because they’re awful all the time.
I had dated a guy years before in New York. A handsome, funny, mean drunk, he slapped me once and wouldn’t let me leave his bed, and I could’ve gotten hurt worse than I did. He didn’t even leave a mark. For years I thought that meant it didn’t matter.
He blacked out with that arm over me, pinning me down. He was more than a foot taller than me, and he was not a weak man. If I fought, it might get worse. I gave up, staring at the ceiling because I knew sleep wouldn’t come.
What was the point in trying to rest? I was no Sleeping Beauty. Everything wouldn’t be better once I woke up. I was, if anything, Sleeping Cute Enough. Magic wasn’t real, and I wasn’t a princess. I was just some random mediocre diversion, one in a long line of losers, a minor character in some handsome fellow’s story, Bluebeard’s bride number 31. Somebody else might defeat him one day and be crowned with the laurels given to true champions, but it wouldn’t be me. My skull is in the basement with the rest of them. Throw another one on the pile.
His arm lay across my body for hours. It was a tree trunk, thick and alive and pulsing with sap. It was a log felled in the forest. It was a broad, unshakeable ceiling beam in a storybook cottage in Fantasyland.
I tried once more to get out, and he moaned in his sleep. “Baby, where are you going?”
“You slapped me,” I said. “I’m leaving.”
“No I didn’t,” he mumbled. “Don’t be silly.”
“Yes you did,” I said, but the arm didn’t move.
“I didn’t do that, but I’m sorry if I did. Come back to me.”
There was no way to leave, so I stayed. I stayed that night and other nights. And I kept staying, until I ran away to California.
Onthe road home from the ranch, listening to the perfect album I used to love from a man I used to want, I blinked several times, remembering more about him. It wasn’t so long ago, but I’d put it all away in some neat little box. The rhythm of the road can jostle the lid until it pops off.
The musician and I had talked and talked. He talked and I listened. Sometimes we flirted a little. He drank and told me I was reading tarot incorrectly and explained how I should be doing it and showed me all the things he had in a California storybook mansion that was either a fairy tale castle or a nightmare lair, depending on your perspective. I thought it was quite tastefully done, honestly. It was exactly how I would decorate if I had all that money and all that time.
He wrote and wrote and wrote, and so did I, in my studio apartment 10 minutes from the house to which he never invited me. I had creaky floors and exposed beams, too. He just had more of them than I did.
After a little while, he began to sound paranoid. He spoke of people trying to get him, of people saying things that weren’t true. He was never specific about who or what, and I wondered if he were delusional. I am the fourth generation in my family to have required psychiatric care, and there are many among us who never received what they needed. I am not unfamiliar with men plagued by delusions, in the clinical sense and otherwise. There’s a reason I thrive in Los Angeles.
“Did you do anything wrong?” I asked.
“No!” he said.
“Well then,” I said, “you’ve got nothing to worry about.”
I suggested addiction therapy, or sobriety meetings. I was not yet in addiction therapy, and I didn’t yet go to sobriety meetings, but telling other people what to do is always more interesting than doing it yourself. I suppose he preferred tarot, hypnotherapy, and the company of women without strong boundaries because they hadn’t lived long enough to grow them yet. I have used all these crutches in my day.
Even my closest friends never ask if they can take a shower while we talk on video, and if they did, I wouldn’t say yes. When he asked, in the midst of a decidedly nonsexual conversation, I said yes. Though I’d cut the booze out, I wasn’t quite sober yet, and sometimes I said yes just to take the ride.
Nothing untoward took place, to my utter relief and sneaking disappointment. He just took a shower, like it was normal. I acted like it was normal. I got the feeling I’d passed some sort of test.
I didn’t want to be a victim. I wanted to be a girlfriend. In the end, I was neither.
One day he stopped responding to calls and messages, and that was that. I was not surprised. He had girlfriends galore, probably, and far closer friends than me, probably. I had work and family and friends of my own, and I got into therapy, and I found out you’re not actually sober if you smoke weed (who knew?) and I got actually sober, one day at a time, which is all you can do, and it’s a lot sometimes.
Women talk. We always have, but it’s easier for us to find each other now. We compare notes. We compare bruises.
I tried to put him out of my mind.
A couple months after he went radio silent, somebody who didn’t know about any of that stuff sent me an article.
“Did you see this?” they asked.
I read it all, all of their stories, and my heart turned cold, though it kept beating, and the sound of it throbbed in my ears. It was cold outside.
Women talk. We always have, but it’s easier for us to find each other now. We compare notes. We compare bruises. I read it all, and the shattered mirror shards he’d shown me assembled in my head as a whole. I saw myself in the reflection.
One of them was a kid when it happened.
I used to teach kids her age. I told them they could tell me anything in their writing, but if they said they were being hurt by somebody or intended to hurt themselves or somebody else, I was legally obligated to tell. Some of them told me anyway and got mad when I did what I said I’d do, but they weren’t stupid. They told me because they couldn’t speak up, and I could. I could say the names. I could do it for them.
I guess I never learned how to say the names for myself.
After a little while, my cold heart started to warm again. The noise got a little quieter. I realized I hadn’t responded to the friend who sent me the link.
“Don’t know how I missed that one,” I said.
I went out to eat with a friend, and our driver was drunk. She was mad, too, and glad that she’d just dumped her no-good boyfriend. She wasn’t swerving, but she stank of booze. We should’ve called the cops, but we didn’t. It was Valentine’s Day. I hope she didn’t kill anybody.
I told my friend the story. She told me about another friend, who told me about another. Los Angeles is the biggest small town in the whole wide world.
“I guess I dodged a bullet,” I said, but that wasn’t true. I ran right at him, full force. I just got lucky because he pointed the gun in another direction. In a lot of other directions actually.
Back to this year, to the road, to the music. It was still as great as I remembered. There’s one perfect album, and there are other ones that are very good. It’s still not worth it.
Magic hour ended. The sun set. I turned him off.
When you clear out the garbage, even the prettiest trash, there’s room for better stuff. Or you just leave a blank space because there’s beauty in the emptiness, when it’s a choice.
It was quiet for awhile and then I put on his ex-girlfriend’s album.
It was the one people couldn’t stop recommending to me, the one my innocent friend described as “haunting.”
Those friends didn’t know the story. There was hardly any story to tell, as far as I was concerned, so why would I say it? I didn’t get hurt. He wasn’t bad to me. I got to see the blueprints executed in black and white in the words of these other women. He left me on the drafting table, and I am thankful for that.
I’d avoided the allegedly haunting album precisely because I knew I’d love it, because I was afraid I’d project my own shit onto her work, and because I want to appreciate a woman on her own fucking terms, and because I didn’t like thinking about him or what I could’ve or should’ve noticed.
I had seen the red flags and called them baby pink. I was ashamed. But my friends didn’t know about all that. They were just trying to give me something actually good.
I drove south toward Los Angeles, and I listened to the whole thing, twice.
Actually, it was not good. Actually, it was fucking great.
And it was not haunting, not to me. It was illuminating and moody and wistful and angry and I forgot who she was in the scheme of my own strange story, until it was over, and I remembered her in context.
A realization hit me, and I put my hand over my heart without thinking. You should really keep both hands on the wheel.
It shocked me, and it shouldn’t matter, and art is art is art and we needn’t compare, but I’ll say it plain, because it’s true: She’s a better writer than he is. And he is a great writer. That’s why it’s astounding to say, and mean, that she’s better. I don’t say it out of bitterness or anger. I’m not angry. I’m just telling you the truth. She’s better, and she’s younger, and if we’re all lucky, she’ll get many more years to make many more songs.
“Fuck,” I said, and I laughed — this time, with genuine delight. What a wonderful surprise.
There were a few songs about him, though she didn’t name him there. She named him elsewhere. A lot of these younger women will do that sooner than us older ones. I like their style.
It was night, and her voice carried me down, down, down the coast, and I thought about California: black and brown cattle in the golden fields, the golden people breathing raggedly the moment they step away from the microphone, coughing up fog and smoke, all of the golden pollen everywhere all of the time, a land where every season is fire season, so many prone bodies barely breathing on ventilators, the skeletons in cold flesh stacked in boxes waiting for the final rest, the people who say they’re sober and aren’t, the people who say they’re sober but won’t be in a minute, the ghost of James Dean and other beautiful people who broke early and stayed that way.
Not everybody stays that way. Sometimes you knit yourself back together because you’re lucky, and you get back out there.
When a woman makes angry art, it is by its very nature a refusal to make nice or back down. It exists on its own as a beautiful blazing thing, but it can also be seen as a denial of anyone’s attempt to make her a supporting player in some asshole’s tragicomic star vehicle. In its disagreeability, it is revolutionary.
We make art because we can’t not make art. People care, or they don’t, but we keep going. We tell the stories we need to tell. It’s okay if it takes some of us longer than others.
On the road, driving down the coast, the western stars above, a couple months away from 40, in the brief space between one song and the next, I said aloud, out of nowhere, “I forgive you.” I say a lot of things out of nowhere.
It wasn’t for him. I wasn’t mad at him, so no forgiveness was necessary. He was sick, and I can hold someone accountable for harm while having compassion for their pain. I hope he gets well, and I hope he stops hurting people the way he did, but it’s none of my business. I have to keep my side of the street clean.
I got home. My cat ignored me for an hour and then walked over as I lay on the couch. She stuck her butt in my face and settled on my chest. She forgave me but wanted me to know who the fuck was in charge. Cats and women are like that sometimes. We have to make sure you hear us.
Afew days later, I was on one of the dating apps I installed. I matched with a guy who was moderately cute, which is good enough for me, in a pandemic or otherwise. It’s always more about the personality for me anyway. We talked about the music he likes to play — he was learning the dulcimer and banjo but mainly collects very old guitars. He has a kitten and he loves his job. He told me I seem really genuinely kind, and I thanked him.
Shortly thereafter, out of nowhere, in the middle of a conversation about how we organize our workspaces at home, he told me to grab my tits for him.
Haunting or not, you can hear a record scratch to a halt in a moment like that.
Grab your tits for me? Really? I was annoyed by his stupid request, but gross men have been saying stuff about my breasts since I was nine years old. What really got me was the utter lack of creativity or finesse in execution. All the words to use, in all the possible combinations, and that’s what he picked? During a global pandemic?! What an execrable, pathetic lack of invention.
Two years ago, I would’ve engaged him in an extensive conversation about why he felt it was appropriate to say such a thing and what was wrong with him and if the allure was actually in the risk of the boundary-crossing and why that was and if he had considered how it might make me feel and did he think he was a sociopath or was he into the shame aspect of it or what, and then I would’ve accepted his apology and continued talking to him, probably about his family issues and the gap where the loving mother should have been and what it was like to have a wire mother and not a cloth mother, or perhaps the absence of the father and whether the father gave him what he really needed and if he felt lonely, and if he felt sad because, after all, maybe this guy is just troubled and trying to connect and I tend to be flirty so maybe he misinterpreted something I said and—
“Dude, you’re gross,” I typed. “Goodbye.” It wasn’t the most eloquently stinging final salvo, but I’m new at this. Baby steps.
“I’m sorry!” he typed. “Come back!”
It’s not two years ago. It’s this year. And this year, I do not have the time.
I unmatched and put down my phone.
His name is Conor. He lives in Santa Monica, and he fucking sucks.

They have a much lower rate of coronary heart disease compared to mainland Japan.
A separate study on Japanese centennials living in Okinawa, where the researcher went back and analyzed at what age these individuals were able to live independently (cook for themselves, do their own house chores, live in their own home, among other factors), came to another fascinating discovery: The study was only on 22 individuals, but among them, 82 percent were still independent at a mean age of 92 years and about two-thirds at a mean age of 97 years old — a lot of Okinawans don’t just live long, it seems they live long, active and happy lives.
There are many factors to a healthy life, but a big one is diet. In an interview with CNN, the researcher leading the study, Craig Willcox, shared that he found Okinawans typically eat seven different fruits and vegetables and 18 different foods a day, and more than 200 different foods and spices regularly in their overall diet. How do they eat so many different kinds of fruits and vegetables? Isn’t 18 different foods a day a lot of food?
I thought to myself, how do they do this? Isnt it difficult to get so many different kinds of vegetables and food in one day?
But if you consider one of the most common and famous Okinawan foods, a stir-fried vegetable dish called chanpuru, maybe this isn’t so impossible. Chanpuru means “to mix together” and can be a variety of different vegetables, but a classic version would include bitter melon (goya), tofu, egg, and bean sprouts, sometimes with carrots, cabbage, or onions. This is often served with a side of sweet potato and miso soup, which is frequently made with seaweed, tofu, and daikon radish. Okinawans also often enjoy a portion of fruit after or between meals, such as pineapple or papaya with some freshly brewed jasmine tea.
It’s not limited to chanpuru — many Okinawan dishes are often an assortment of different vegetables, such as Okinawan jyushi or papaya irichi. Their diet is particularly aware of the idea of eating lots of different kinds of vegetables every day — meals are often colorful, and include an assortment of leafy vegetables, root vegetables, and sea vegetables. Suddenly, I could see how one could easily get so many different kinds of vegetables in one day.
And this is why the Okinawan diet works: Their focus is on getting a large variety of fresh vegetables and fruit, rather than becoming hyper-focused on increasing your intake of one “superfood” vegetable or eliminating an entire food category that has been deemed “bad” by the public. Their meals are never just tofu or bitter melon, and they’ll frequently have rice or noodles, instead of just sweet potato. Their meals are often a colorful assortment of different vegetables and food types, of different colors and textures.
So don’t worry about eating more “superfoods” like kale, tiger nuts, or Indian gooseberries: The key to eating well is paying closer attention to the variety of fresh fruits and vegetables you eat in a day — seven a day, if you can.

Here are the 11 biggest mistakes I made', author: 'Insider', url:'https://medium.com/insider/i-failed-at-van-life-here-are-11-mistakes-i-made-87d4bc74ed70', time: 6, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*9iH8MMTirXCOXSoZnsx7Ow.jpeg', description: 'By Mana Gale', content: 'By Mana Gale
My fascination with van life started on a summer road trip with my college roommates. “Wouldn’t it be nice,” I thought, “to live like this all the time?”
For several years afterward, I took more road trips and spent hours looking through Instagram pictures and YouTube videos of other people’s van-life highlight reels.
When I finally began living on the road, I fell in love with cruising over the summit of a mountain, waking up in my cozy bunk, and sipping coffee while the world was waking up. But this lifestyle involved more downsides than I ever saw on social media.
Eventually, I realized this nomadic life just wouldn’t work for me. Here are some of the mistakes I wish I’d avoided:
I chose my vehicle without thinking about which would be best for my needs
One of the earliest and most crucial decisions is picking the right vehicle.
The options blew my mind: Westfalias, Sprinters, sketchy white cargo vans, truck campers, truck tops, trailers, vintage RVs, buses of all sizes, and much, much more.
But instead of researching and considering my practical needs, I came into my vehicle in a series of accidents.
While working a seasonal job in Wyoming, I totaled my Corolla hitting a deer. A grandparent died suddenly, and I bought his truck. My seasonal job ended, and I decided that I was going to do this van-life thing, no matter how unprepared I felt. So I jumped in and bought a camper top.
My truck/camper top pairing has certain advantages, like a cab-over for storage space, excellent clearance, four-wheel-drive, towing capacity, and a huge backseat for friends and gear.
But I didn’t think about street parking an 8-foot-3 vehicle next to short trees or overgrown bushes, getting warnings from the city and complaints from neighbors, or being unable to access my camper from my car and vice versa.
I hadn’t secured a new stream of income before leaving my job
On the road, I spent little money, slept in free campsites, ate inexpensive provisions, and used a cushion of savings.
I’d intended to start freelance writing (or something) and realized pretty quickly that those jobs were competitive and far from certain. They also didn’t pay up quickly and freelancing made me anxious.
My dream career choice was incompatible with life on the road
The more I wrote in coffee shops and searched for freelance writing jobs, the more I realized that I didn’t want to write — at least, not as a full-time job.
Besides, I’d discovered a new direction: I wanted to cook. Pursuing that career seriously was totally incompatible with turning my life into a perpetual road trip.
I had inadequate ways to deal with the cold weather
Since I spent some time driving around parts of the US that get cold in the winter, I experienced chilling weather day and night.
There were limited ways to mitigate this. I could bundle up, get the blood flowing with a brisk hike, head south, blast the heat, hide out in a coffee shop for a few hours, or curl up under many layers.
There’s really no escaping the cold, only mediation between comfort and sanity.
A recent trip along the Oregon Coast reminded me yet again why I hated living in my truck in cold weather. I spent the first night in a pullout up a twisty National Forest road in sub-freezing temperatures. After a sleepless night, I left just in time to avoid getting snowed in.
Night two, unable to find suitable free camping, I caved and paid $20 to stay at a state-park campground. Eventually, it started to rain and the nasty drizzle in unrelenting 37-degree Fahrenheit weather made a campfire impossible.
When the sun set, I retreated to the camper, cranked my propane-powered Little Buddy heater, and spent a few hours listening to podcasts, watching condensation stick my curtains to my walls, and worrying about the possibility of carbon-monoxide poisoning if I fell asleep with the heater running.
My van didn’t provide any great way to deal with the hot weather, either
As a Floridian, I prefer hot weather. But heatwaves leave van-dwellers with even fewer options.
I left my windows open, kicked my sheets off, and prayed I’d find an icy creek and a cool breeze somewhere along the road.
I wasn’t ready to give up hobbies that I loved
I knew life on the road would mean giving up some aspects of my life. I was prepared to sacrifice daily showers, but paring down my art projects hurt.
If you’re also someone with tools, crafts, keepsakes, and hobbies, then moving into a vehicle full-time might not be for you.
Establishing a routine was hard, and it took a toll on my mental health
Although one might expect a perpetual vacation to lead to happiness, living on the road actually hurt my mental health. Routines — for me, the building blocks of mental health — tended to be harder to establish or adjust.
Seeing a therapist in person seemed impossible and prescription pickup got complicated. All of my problems didn’t disappear when I left my day job.
The loneliness was more overwhelming than I anticipated
Loneliness becomes pretty hard to alleviate when you’re constantly on the move.
It’s more difficult to connect to communities and make friends, especially because many of the normal avenues are only available to people with stationary lives.
I got too comfortable sleeping indoors and lost a connection to nature
Sleeping in a tent unnerves me, I’ll admit.
The forest talks at night and it’s impossible not to listen. When the moon shines, you see shapes moving through the rain cover and it’s difficult to distinguish plant from beast. Sleeping outside with little between you and the world is nothing like sleeping in the safety and comfort of your home, even if it’s on wheels.
With a camper, you never have to pitch a tent and your bed is always warm and cozy. But there’s a sneaky downside to this: I stopped sleeping outside.
The forest at night scares me sometimes, but I want to be closer to it. By always sleeping inside, I lost that tie to nature without even realizing it.
I didn’t consider how horrible it would be to get sick on the road
It was nice to go on daily hikes, swim in lakes, and stretch while watching the sunset.
But when things did go wrong, I was stuck in a parking lot somewhere, incapacitated, with limited resources and no one to take care of me.
Stomach bugs with the comforts of a stationary home are bad enough. A stomach bug on the road had me up all night, crouched in the cold outside my truck, alternating between staring up at the crystal clear milky way, vomiting into a trash can, and wishing for death.
Getting emotionally attached to my vehicle made it hard to let go of this life
As my ambitions changed and I realized that the nomadic life wasn’t for me, holding onto the truck felt silly.
On a daily basis, it’s terrible on gas and even worse with parking. Neighbors occasionally hate it. When I leave it parked on the street, I worry about break-ins and theft.
During the summer, I spend many weekends camping, although I am learning once more to sleep outside. I take road trips, when my job allows, and I relish the feeling of leaving the pavement for gravel and dirt.
Still, potentially giving up my vehicle feels terrifying and painful.
I think once things open up I’ll probably plan one last big trip. After that, I think I’m done with van life for good.', category: Category.third)

On October 18, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened over 1 million air travelers in a single day, an emblematic number that hadn’t been reached since March. With the holiday season approaching, even more people may be encouraged to hop on a plane to visit their families.
“I do have a general sense that people are getting a little tired of not traveling or being isolated from their family and friends. They are looking forward to the holidays to get back together,” says Henry Wu, MD, director of Emory TravelWell Center and associate professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. That, of course, is concerning given that Covid-19 numbers are hitting daily records in the U.S., having reached over 170,000 cases on November 13, and may continue to rise particularly with colder weather, according to Wu.
    But here’s the good news: “We are learning a lot on how to prevent this infection on an aircraft […]. The precautions in place are certainly much better than they were early in this outbreak,” Wu says.
Over five months ago, when I first wrote about the risks of flying during the pandemic, there wasn’t strong evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard an aircraft. But with more data available, this has changed. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently reported that, up until early October, there had been 44 reported cases of Covid-19 likely acquired during a flight.
One of the largest clusters connected with a flight was seen in passengers flying from London to Hanoi on March 2. A 27-year-old woman seated in business class experienced a sore throat and was coughing throughout the flight. When she was later diagnosed with Covid-19, a tracing effort revealed that 15 other passengers on that flight had been infected, 12 of whom were also in business class.
An important caveat: This happened back in March when masks were neither recommended nor widely used on airplanes. In fact, this was also the case in two other flights with Covid-19 mass transmission, according to a recent review. “The fact that these large clusters related to airplanes were early in the pandemic when not everyone was wearing a mask, and the fact that more recently there hasn’t been such large clusters, is another proof of the importance of wearing masks,” says Wu.
One notable example where masks probably prevented a superspreader event was a flight in February that repatriated 11 Israeli citizens who had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, where almost 20% of the ship’s population came down with Covid-19. All of the Israeli passengers who boarded the aircraft to go home tested negative in Japan before departure. “Still, we knew that they came from the Diamond Princess and we were reluctant with the fact that they were flying and anticipated that one or two could be positive,” says Ran Nir-Paz, MD, associate professor at the department of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre.
“Overall the risk is very low, as most of the aerosol is removed, even nearby an infected person, before it can settle out on a surface.”
They were instructed to wear masks at all times, even when sleeping, only removing it for a brief period to eat and drink. Upon arrival, they were retested and two of them were found to be positive. The investigation later showed that they were probably infected before boarding and were infectious during the flight (in the first few days of infection, before the virus builds up to detectable levels, there is a high probability of a false negative result, which could explain why their predeparture tests came back negative). Still, no other passenger got sick.
“We assumed that the major intervention was the fact that they were wearing masks most of the time,” says Nir-Paz. Given that this was a 14-hour long flight, the fact that nobody else got infected despite so much time in close proximity to the two passengers with Covid-19 is reassuring.
Anairplane’s ventilation system is also quite effective in eliminating viruses and other germs. The filters used on planes, called high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, are able to remove beyond 99% of infectious pathogens.
A more recent study conducted for the Department of Defense by researchers from several institutions and organizations, including United Airlines and Boeing (which may raise awareness for potential bias), simulated how the virus would likely spread through the plane’s cabin. The tests involved placing an “infected passenger” (a masked mannequin expelling fluorescent microspheres made of a synthetic material roughly the same size as the novel coronavirus) in different rows and seats to determine how far those particles would be able to reach and how long would it take for them to be filtered out.
The tests showed that, on an airplane, microparticles are removed from the air 15 times faster than in a typical house: six minutes on the airplane versus 1.5 hours in the house. Does that mean that the risk of transmission is lower on an airplane compared with other enclosed spaces?
“Yes, for a similar number of sick people located at a similar distance, the risk is definitely lower because of the very high air exchange rate, downward ventilation design, and HEPA filtered recirculation,” says Sean Kinahan, senior threat scientist at the National Strategic Research Institute at the University of Nebraska and one of the authors of the study.
They also measured the number of particles on contaminated surfaces. “Overall the risk is very low, as most of the aerosol is removed, even nearby an infected person, before it can settle out on a surface,” Kinahan says. The study concluded that, in a situation where all flyers are wearing masks, the risk of virus transmission is minimal, even if the airplane is at full seating capacity.
Try to reduce the time of your meal to 15 minutes or less and, if there are other passengers eating around you, wait for them to be finished and put their masks back on before you remove your own mask to eat.
All of this recent knowledge about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircrafts might help you decide whether you want to fly during the pandemic. In general, experts encourage people to have a higher threshold for evaluating their need to travel this year. “Don’t rush to book a trip just because you feel like you need a vacation,” says Claire Westmacott, MPH, a public health specialist at the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers (IAMAT). “Travelers have to be aware of their responsibility and their privilege, and travel very carefully.”
Here is some more advice to help you stay safe if you do choose to travel.
Planning your trip
Several destinations have restrictions or requirements in place for incoming travelers, such as providing proof of a recent negative PCR test or proof of travel health insurance. Some even specifically require proof of Covid-19 related coverage, according to Westmacott. If you are traveling internationally, your best resource is IATA’s interactive map, where you can click on any country to find out about possible restrictions. Domestic travelers can check their destination’s state health department for up-to-date guidance.
Remember that you have a social responsibility to quarantine upon arrival at your destination and when returning home, and many locations explicitly require it, so prepare accordingly. In some locations like the state of New York, out-of-state travelers may exit quarantine sooner if they follow certain testing guidelines.
Keep in mind there may be abrupt changes to your travel plans. “Particularly the possibility that travelers may have to stay at their destination for a much longer period of time than they anticipated, for example, if they’re exposed to the virus, or they become sick themselves and have to quarantine before returning,” says Westmacott.
On that note, Westmacott advises considering your own personal ability to handle uncertainty and stress and how much financial risk you are willing to take.
Be aware of increased negative attitudes toward visitors. “At this time, travelers really need to ensure that they’re making responsible choices and being conscious of their impact on the communities that they visit,” Westmacott says.
Get the influenza shot, if you haven’t already. Although it doesn’t protect against Covid-19, influenza can be quite common during travel, notes Wu. “Influenza and Covid-19 can look very similar. So, it can cause a lot of problems if you were to develop influenza during your trip,” he says.
Don’t travel if you are feeling sick or have been in contact with a Covid-19 patient 14 days prior to the trip.
Keeping safe inside the airplane
Wear a face mask, even when sleeping, and only remove it when you need to eat or drink.
Keep sanitizer handy and use it often, including before and after eating or adjusting your mask.
Try to reduce the time of your meal to 15 minutes or less and, if there are other passengers eating around you, wait for them to be finished and put their masks back on before you remove your own mask to eat.
Wipe down your seat, tray table, and armrest with a disinfectant wipe. “You can be pretty sure that they’ve been cleaned before you boarded but, just in case, it’s a good thing to do,” says Westmacott.
If you need to go to the lavatory, try to wait for a moment when there is no line. You may also wipe surfaces with a disinfectant wipe before touching them. Needless to say, wash your hands thoroughly before returning to your seat.', category: Category.third)

My Italian teacher was exasperated because my literary school productions sound like an XVI century piece. I have been reading Emilio Salgari’s masterpiece, Sandokan in that period. To lead my Italian back to the XX century, she recommended me “My family and other animals” by Gerald Durrell, as a summer reading. It was an epiphany! The book talks about the author’s childhood in Corfu. He spent his time observing bugs, turtles, and birds in the olives groves, while many other funny things happened with his family. Theodore Stefanides was his friend, one of the last polymaths. I lived in an Italian province, with streets made of the concrete and anonymous building. What a dream feeling the grass under my feet and wake up in an olives’ grove.
I read the Corfu Trilogy (My family and other animals, Birds, Beasts, and Relatives and The Garden of the Gods) again in 2020. Because of the strong lockdown, traveling was impossible. I had to run away, suddenly. Those books bring me back to Corfu with Gerry, Larry, Teo, and Spiro. It was like a glass of fresh water after a long walk under the midday sun.
My family and I choose to spend our holidays on Emerald Island this year. We choose to do it partially on Durrells’ footprints.
Travel Planning
Making a trip plan is like analysis for software. Maybe the most exciting part.
Corfu is the great of the Ionian Greek islands. It lays in front of the Albanian coast. With the islands of Paxos and Antipaxos, Fanò, and others, it creates an archipelago. You can reach those other islands by boat.
You can go to Corfu in two ways from Italy:
using a ferry from Brindisi or Bari. It needs 8 hours trip;
using airplane. It takes 1 hour or 2, based on your starting point. For example, it takes 1 hour and 10 minutes from Rome.
Traveling by ferry is a suggestive one. Lawrence Durrell did in 1935:
But once you strike out from the flat and desolate Calabrian mainland towards the sea, you are aware of a change in the heart of things: aware of the horizon beginning to stain at the rim of the world: aware of islands coming out of the darkness to meet you. — L. Durrell, Prospero’s Cell.
The travel by ferry is the hardest one from Rome. You drive from Rome to Brindisi (600km / 370 miles more or less) and then spend 8 hours on a ferry. This is why we choose the airplane trip(the prices were comparable).
You could stay in one of many centers in Corfu: Italian travel agencies choose Ipsos. Ipsos is the town where Italian teenagers accommodate. Discos, late-night pubs, and noisy crowds are as common as mozzarella cheese in a Margherita. This is why we preferred Dassia instead.
Dassia is a family-friendly center with ταβέρνες in front of the sea and quiet studios. It is a well-served town with supermarkets and pharmacies. It is 10 km far away from Corfu Town too.
Other centers, like Kavos or Kanoni, are too far away from the beaches in the north or, like Sidari and Roda, too far away from Kerkira.
My wife and I did many searches on specialized sites. In the end, we chose the hotel represented behind:
The hotel host helped us contacting a car agency in Dassia. They bring the car to the airport and driven us back to our left.
From a tech point of view: Greece adopts the European GSM standard for mobile communications. According to EU law on international roaming, you can use your national plan without extra effort. I had no problems roaming over Wind GR. I had only one limitation: 5 GN for data usages.
From an electric point of view, Greece adopts a standard voltage of 230 V and the standard frequency is 50 Hz. No adapter needs if your devices expose a schuko socket.
We flight to Corfu on Wednesday, and here are the places we visited.
Barbati — Μπαρμπάτι
Barbati is a little tourist center 10 km far away from Dassia. You take the road to Kassiopi. Closed to Ipsos, after some hairpin bends, you reach the Barbati area.
Take one of the roads on your right: everyone will bring you to the beach. Drive slowly! Barbati beach is one of the most equipped ones: some tavernas are there. You can rent a couple of sunbeds and a sun umbrella for 7€ per day.
Mount Pantokrator, the highest hill in Corfu, dominates the beach on the land side.
The beach is made of pebbles, so you need rock shoes to take a bath. The water is crystal, but there is no sea life close to the beach. Olives and tamarisks trees are all around you: if you would like you can lay in their shadow instead of a sun umbrella.
Barbati is where The Angry Barrels, the last chapter of Birds, Beasts, and Relatives, is set. Here is Gerry’s description:
[…] we reached our destination, a half-mile-long beach that lay under the flanks of Pantokrator. Here the olive grove came almost the sea, separated from it only by a white stripe of shingle. — G. Durrell, Birds, Beasts, and Relatives.
I wasn’t able to locate Mr. Stavrodakis’s villa if some of you have more information, let me know.
A geek note: the 4G technology works well, this lets me use social media with good bandwidth. All tavernas allow you to connect to their wifi: the signal is good at the tables, worst at the beach because of the distance.
Kalami — Καλάμι
Kalami is the place where Lawrence Durrell and his wife Nancy chose to live. Here stays the White House:
A white house set like a dice on a rock already venerable with the scars of wind and water — L. Durrell Prospero’s Cell
Today it is a hotel with a nearby taverna: you can book it at its own website. It became a brand: souvenirs, books, postcards are all in the name of The White House. The commercial transformation of this place did not dispel the enchantment of the place let Nancy fall in love with it. In fact, Nancy, with help from Teo, discovered this little piece of Eden.
To drive to Kalami, follow the street to Kontokali, climbing on the shoulders of the Pantokrator. You find a deviation from the main road which brings you to Kouloura and Kalami after 16km of bends.
Be aware of the street: no guard rail is for the steep downhill. Stay safe and enjoy the stunning landscape while going down.
Kalami is a little town full of studios for renting, with a couple of supermarkets and restaurants on the beach. Houses are embraced by olive groves, cypresses, and judas trees.
There are pebbles on the shore and in the sea, this is why you need rock shoes. The bay is small with cold transparent water. You can find two piers where guys enjoy dives. You can rent a kayak if you like.
Kalami is one of the preferred places for sailboats to dock: there are a great number of boats off the shore enjoying a bath in those crystal water. The bay is closed on the right sight by the White House and by a cliff on the left. The Albanian coast is only 5 km far away from you.
Geeky note: your smartphone will hang the Albanian network many times: check your plan before trying to take a call or using messaging applications. The net is not very good but free wifi, or the one from your taverna, could help a lot.
Saint Stefano — Αγίου Στεφάνου
Following the main road to Kassiopi, you’ll meet another crossroad that brings you to a small bay. Here a town, embraced by olives’ grove, lays. It is Agios Stefanos.
The street is winding and steep, be aware and enjoy your trip. It will end at the shore.
The bay is like a swimming pool. It is as wide as 1km and the water is no more than 10 meters in depth. It is perfect for a family with small children. Do not forget your rock shoes if you would like to swim! You cannot approach the water without.
If you look into the bottom, you will see sea urchins living between the rocks. Many tourists catch them: I think you have not to do it, sea urchin is an endangered species as in Greece as in Italy.
    You can lay under the big tamarisk tree shadow that dominates the bay or have a walk and start exploring the Erimitis natural park. We stopped here, it was too hot for us.
    Many sailors like this part of the islands, which is one of the less touristic ones. They anchor off-shore or in the bay to enjoy a swim in those crystal waters.
    Palaiokastritsa — Παλαιοκαστρίτσα
    Palaiokastritsa is one of the most snapped areas of Corfu. This is not a beach or a town, as many think, it is an entire district. It counts more than six bays.
    The most known beaches are
    - Agios Petros
    - Agios Spiridon
    - Ampelaki
Reaching Palaiokastritsa is quite simple. You have to follow the signals from the Gouvia’s crossroad. The street will guide you directly to both Agios Spiridon and Agios Petros beaches.
Beaches are little bays here with pebbles beaches. If you would to rent a couple of sunbeds and a sun umbrella, wake up early in the morning. We could find none at ten a.m.
The water is cold, crystal, and full of sea life: small fishes swim around your legs while you are choosing to swim or go back to the shore because of the iced water.
Paleokastritsa is well known for the monastery that on top of the hill dominates the bays. A steep street guides you to its door. I recommend you to have a walk to the monastery, to enjoy the view of the area when ascending.
When you’re on the top of the hill, you can see a small island opposite Agios Petros. A legend told us this is the Scheria, the boat used by the Pheacis to bring Odysseus back to Ithaca in the myth. According to the legend, the boat was transformed into an island when it came back from Ithaca. Another island pretends to be the Scheria: it is Vidos, which lays in front of Kontokali. Many agree to identify Corfu as the island of the Pheacis in the myth of course.
Larry agrees with the first version of the myth:
Odysseus must have met Nausicaa at Paleocastritsa; it is not possible to believe otherwise. — L. Durrell, The Greek Islands
If you are not interested in religion, you’ll enjoy its garden and the museum, instead. It’s a luxury roof garden, where judas tree and purple flower rule. The iconography is typically byzantine: blue, gold, and red are the main colors.
Geek note: the 4G technology works not very well at the beach: I had small bandwidth and the What’s App application takes a while to send messages.
Corfu Town — Κέρκυρα
The architecture of the town is Venetian; the houses above the old port are built up elegantly into slim houses with narrow alleys and colonnades running between them; red, yellow, pink, umber[…] — L. Durrell, Prospero’s Cell
Corfu Town is the main town of the island: you can feel its Venetian spirit having a walk throw the old town while you’re being insane with the color of the palaces. You can think you’re in French when having a coffee in a bar under the Liston as well.
One of the most attractive parts of the city is the Old Fortress: many ways and passages drive you here. It stands upon the old port and the Saint George church. The church is peculiar for foreigners because it looks like an ancient Greek temple. Many remember it because the Duke of Edinburgh was christened here as a member of the Greek royal family.
The island is really the Saint: and the saint is the island. Nearly all the male children are named after him. — L. Durrell, Prospero’s cell
These few works depict very well the relationship between Saint Spyridon and the island. There is a Saint Spyridon dedicated newsstand at every crossroad at every remote place. Well, calling a child Spiro is not a missed custom: I met more than five Spiro in a week! The younger is closed to fifty.
The church bell tower is visible everywhere. The bells sound the hour and you can hear them everywhere in the city. If you’re interested in listening to them, have a youtube search: many videos are.
There is a place where you can turn on candles as a pray just outside the church. You could bring your own, or buy one. Then you could access the church and visit the saint.
Saint Spyridon lays in its silver coffin in a small room on the right side of the iconostasis( I’m catholic if some greek orthodox is reading, please correct me). Images of the Archangels frescos the room, while ex-votos are pending from the ceiling. Taking pictures is not permitted, but official ones could be found on the net.
Who visits Saint Sypidon, kisses his coffin, relies on him, then comes out backward from the church.
Geek note: the phone works great in the upper part of the town: near the fortress, closed to Liston, and near the new port. It doesn’t work into the Old Town. It is not a problem: leave your phone in your backpack or use it only to take some pictures. Sit at a table and order ouzo!
No one is ever in a hurry in Corfu, siga siga! (slow, slow!)

Conclusion
This story is not to be intended as a full travel guide to Corfu, its landscape, and its history. Many others tried to do this, and in a better way than me, of course. One of them was Theodor Stefanides himself.
Many must-see places I did not visit in a week: Port Timoni, Erimitis beaches, the Mouse Island, Kaiser William II Observatory, the Achilleion … and as many as an island with the history and immense nature like Corfu could offer.
I hope you enjoyed my piece and that in some part of your spirit you’re considering Corfu as a place to visit.

75% of them will fail.
How can you avoid becoming one of the majority and instead find yourself with a life-long badge of honor and accomplishment? Surely it’s just a matter of walking really far each day, sleeping, then doing it all over again the next day — it’s only 4–6 months, right?
Oh, if only it were that simple.
Here are the top reasons thru-hikers don’t complete their goal, along with methods to avoid each pitfall.
Lack of funds
As you will see, most of the top reasons come from a lack of planning and preparation — funding the adventure is no different.
Although a thru-hike can be completed for very little money (technically; $1500 has been reported), most will ultimately underestimate their individual spending. There’s a good reason for this: most non-thru-hikers will completely underestimate the allure of town and all its creature comforts.
A good rule of thumb is about 1,000 US dollars per month.
However, it’s also a good rule to have about 50% more cash in reserve just in case your end up being one of the big spenders.
Injury or lack of physical preparation
A common question posed by hikers regards training prior to a thru-hike. This question comes in two main forms: 1. does physical preparation matter once I hit the trail, and 2. how much backpacking experience should I have before attempting a thru-hike?
Some people still sometimes manage to go from inexperienced couch potato to successful thru-hiker. Just don’t expect that approach to have a high probability of success. — Raiden, “Sauntering Thru”
Anyone who has done much hiking will confirm that the best training for long-distance hiking is, in fact, long-distance hiking. Sometimes this is said with an air of resignation and leads people to essentially winging it on the trail.
I would argue that you should do the next best thing. Hike as much as you can and supplement that with gym training targeting muscle groups that are the most used while backpacking. The Stair Stepper was my gym-machine of choice, but I also focused on my core, knee-stabilizing muscles, ankle stabilizers, and the trapezius to give more padding where my pack would rest.
“Even if you devote your life 100% to physically preparing, it still won’t get you into the shape the trail will, but getting a head start is going to pay off tremendously.” –Gusha, Hiker Feed
Increased physical fitness will lead to a lower probability of injury, more comfort while hiking, and a faster overall pace making it more likely you will reach the end on time (see discussion below).
For a more in-depth discussion on preparation, see this article.
Lack of motivation, boredom, lack of mental preparation
Although thru-hiking is a massive physical undertaking, many people (myself included) find the mental challenges of the trail to be the hardest test.
When we head out for a long hike, the primary expectation is that despite the hard work (or perhaps because of it?) we will get to enjoy nature to the fullest and come back refreshed and revitalized. This is absolutely true for short backpacking trips in my experience. But ask yourself, how long until this amazement and beauty (both of which depend on the novelty of it all) will wear off?
The answer, in the experience of most thru-hikers, is about 500 miles or 25% of the trail (for the AT).
This is what leads to the “Virginia Blues”; and while you may think it won’t happen to you, I suggest you come prepared. I believe the best antidote is to have secondary objectives to complete in your spare time. This may very well be the most creative time in your life, be prepared to express yourself in some way such as writing (I used a voice-to-text program as discussed here).
Family issues
One of the major factors that will take a hiker off-trail is problems in the family, and often, there isn’t much we can do about this one other than expect the unexpected.
To prepare for the possibility of illness or death in the family, simply have a protocol in the back of your mind for what you will do if something happens. This preparation will help you avoid making rash decisions in short amounts of time. For example, if there is a death you will likely get off-trail — the only question then is, will you come back?
Having a plan in place reduces the likelihood of you using any circumstance as an “excuse” to quit. I’m not saying that people are wrong for going home when the family needs them (family comes first). But I am saying that you may, even unconsciously, let any possible reason to quit become your excuse for doing so (this is the nature of such a long-term challenge).
Be prepared for anything that could come up, have a plan in place to handle it, and know that you will ultimately finish the trail no matter what.
Running out of time
Each of the major thru-hikes in the United States has a season and with this a time limit of sorts.
For the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide Trails, this is a variable time limit that is dictated by snow in the north. For the Appalachian Trail, the Northern Terminus at Mount Katadhin closes October 22 due to increasingly dangerous weather conditions. For these reasons, part of your planning should include the direction of hiking and a plan for your approach if you are going to miss your deadline.
If you’re running low on time, there are two major ways to solve the problem. The first is to flip-flop by jumping ahead on the trail (usually to the end) and walking back to where you left the trail. This is still considered a complete thru-hike.
The other option is to come back next year (thus completing the trail as a section-hike). Though this solution is unfavorable for most, it is a solution to essentially every reason that a thru-hiker may leave the trail without completing it.
Summary
You will notice that almost every one of these reasons that people quit the trail are due to a lack of preparation.
You will meet many on the trail who seemed to just be winging it — they are in the minority and they have a much higher chance of failure for the reasons mentioned above. Approach this endeavor with the seriousness it deserves and come prepared.
Have access to 50% more cash than you expect to need
Be in decent shape before starting to prevent injury
Have secondary goals, or entertainment, to stave off boredom
Have a plan in place for the things that may take you off-trail (and make sure part of that plan is to come back)
Don’t worry about your time, but do keep track of it and be prepared to adjust if necessary
If you are brave and adventurous enough to attempt a thru-hike, then I believe you have what it take to succeed. The only thing between you and your goal is the know-how, the preparation, and a lot of hard work over the next few thousand miles.
Good luck!

While it was undoubtedly one of the best decisions of my life, here are three things I wish I’d known before packing up my life and buying a one-way ticket to Mexico:
1. There is Mexican Mexico and then there is International/Westernised Mexico.
In hindsight, this was very naive of me, but prior to my arrival in Mexico, I had grand visions of perfecting my Spanish, chatting to the locals, immersing myself fully in the culture, language, and day-to-day life of Mexico. I was thrilled at the idea of learning another language, feeling like a local, and experiencing the real Mexico.
Boy, oh boy, was I wrong.
The reality has been more like receiving tiny snippets of Mexico, and great big doses of international tourism, flocks of remote ‘digital nomad’ workers, and everyone speaking English!
But it’s not all bad.
Because of this western influence, day-to-day life is incredibly comfortable. I can still find western coffee shops, practice my Spanish and enjoy tacos all in one place. I have the option every time I open my mouth to speak in Spanish or in English, I can choose to eat traditionally or enjoy Western/International food and I feel safe, knowing my community around me is comprised of a huge variety of men, women, and children from all over the world.
Tourism is a huge cornerstone to the Mexican economy and while the influence of western culture and gentrification is no doubt impacting the traditional culture, the money and opportunities brought in from this industry is also essential to the local economy. It’s a bit of a catch 22.
While this influence will fluctuate from town to town and region to region, I am learning to appreciate the combination of western convenience meets traditional Mexican culture. I love buying my fruit and veggies from my local tienda, yet also having the option to shop in an organic health food store. I love the choice of authentic street tacos or vegan brunch cafes. And I love being part of a community heralding from every corner of the earth.
2. The internet connection will never be 100% reliable
Once in Mexico, it becomes common knowledge that the internet connection is genuinely pretty average. Ranging from great one second to complete outages that can last hours and hours if not days!
Yet everyone manages to get by. Just the other day the signal went out for the entire region leaving phone lines, wifi connections, and basically all technology useless for almost four hours.
Learning to lean into the flow and surrender to that which you can’t control (a.k.a. the wifi) can be a steep learning curve, yet also a powerful lesson in surrender. When the wifi is out, you have no choice but to go enjoy the beach, step away from your devices and just be present in this beautiful part of the world. It’s the perfect reminder to ground yourself, be present, and remember who you at your core.
If you want a more reliable connection, you can generally head to the bigger cities but even there, there are no guarantees. It’s just life in Mexico!
3. Life will never be the same again
Once you’ve tasted freedom, there is no going back. Life in Mexico is liberating, it’s exciting and it’s fun every single day.
Imagine waking up each morning and starting your day with a beach swim or surf. Then taking your time to grab a coffee, say hi to a few neighbours and friends before working poolside or in a cute little cafe.
As you wrap up your workday, imagine yourself picking up some delicious Mexican food to take down to the beach, to enjoy with friends as you watch the sunset, sip a margarita, and marvel at the beauty of life all around you.
Once you start living a life like this, you can never go back. The idea of sitting in an office, commuting hours each day, or sitting in traffic is no longer viable. Once you’ve experienced this freedom, this beauty, and this way of living, life starts to feel fun and easy. Things start to align and flow like never before and suddenly, you feel lighter, brighter, and more yourself than you’ve ever experienced.
Of course, not every day is sunshine and rainbows, even in Mexico, but if you feel the pull to create a life for yourself here, or anywhere abroad, I could not recommend it more!
After five months in Mexico, I can’t imagine ever leaving. I feel incredibly grateful, privileged, and fortunate to live this lifestyle every day, but that is not to say you can’t achieve this too! With the state of the world, moving abroad can feel challenging and scary right now, but it is still available to you. The choice is always yours.

', content: 'From root beer to peanut butter and jelly, here are the surprising American favorites that British people just can’t get on board with.
By Erin McDowell
Twinkies. Corn dogs. Peanut butter with jelly.
It turns out that cherished food combinations and pantry staples of many Americans often strike horror into the hearts — and stomachs — of British people brave enough to taste them.
British Quora users shared which American food items they just don’t understand, from the biggest brand names to the obscure and bizarre foods Americans love, as well as the foods Brits think are completely and utterly disgusting.
Many complaints focused on foods that seemed and tasted artificial or “fake,” as well as too sugary. British people also had a problem with Americans’ larger portion sizes.
“A Twinkie would be much more enjoyable if it had fresh cream and non-stale cake.” — Franki Marsh.
Many foreigners maintain that Hershey’s tastes faintly like vomit.
“I don’t know what it is, but it is not chocolate.” — Doug Hepburn.
“Hershey’s horrible powdery chocolate springs to mind.” — Neil Anderson.
“I tried a well-known brand called Hershey’s and it tasted of vomit. Seriously. I was as astonished as I was revolted.” — Guy Roberts.
Sweet salad dressings defeat the point of a salad.
“Why would you put sugar in salad dressing? Doesn’t that kind of ruin the whole point of salad?” — Adam M. Steiner.
Chicken-fried steak covered in gravy turned many Brits off.
“Take a piece of steak. But not too good, like rib eye or flank, because that fat is bad for your arteries, and flank may taste great but it’s on the chewy side. No, something boringly lean and puritanical, like round steak.
“Bread it, so that it not only won’t acquire that nice caramelized outer coating, it can’t acquire it. Fry it, so that you have bread encasing flabby grey beef. (Arteries? What arteries?)
“Douse it with gravy, to console yourself for the fact that you could have been having a good steak instead of grey meat coated in greasy bread.
“Oh, wait, what? The gravy has to be made with milk? I just threw up a little in my mouth. Look, forget the whole thing.” — Alex Johnston.
Packaged bread was deemed too sweet.
“All the American bread from shops was sweet. I found it really unpleasant — the only ‘proper’ bread was in a mid-level restaurant that had decent, unsweetened wholemeal bread with a soup.” — Jonathan Elder.
“Supermarket wrapped bread is invariably very, not to say extraordinarily, sweet to a European palette. I find it completely inedible. It ruins the taste of anything, and everything, sandwiched between it. Essentially it is cake masquerading as bread.” — Toby Low.
Bacon is an American favorite, but many Brits thought it was too greasy, salty, and not meaty enough.
“The bacon is basically fried cardboard that seems to have been dipped in salt. You couldn’t make a decent bacon sarnie [sandwich] with it.” — Paul Jones.
Huge portions of food — like giant turkey legs at theme parks — made Brits sick to their stomachs.
“There is a lot of meat on a turkey leg. It’s more meat than anyone needs to eat over the course of a few days, let alone as a snack while walking around a theme park. The first bite tasted OK, if a little uninspiring, but it soon became a chore.
“My good old-fashioned northern-English stubbornness and dislike of waste forbade me to throw it away until I had made a reasonable dent in it though, and I ate far more of it than I should.
“I would wake up in the night for months afterward with visions of that turkey leg and how thoroughly unappetizing it became. There is no need for such gluttony.” — Simon Crump.
Boxed macaroni and cheese is thought to be totally disgusting.
“Americans have so many foods that are processed and come from boxes or tins and have little to do with the original ingredients — like Kraft Mac & Cheese.” — Tamara Stevens.
    “Macaroni and cheese should never be out of a cardboard box.” — Debsy Opperman.', category: Category.third)

Wanderlust is real and if you live to travel, watching travel docs or donning a mask and lingering in the international foods section of your grocery store just isn’t going to scratch that itch.
If you’ve spent an inordinate amount of time over the past few months dreaming about the next big adventure on your horizon, you’re certainly not alone. In fact, more and more travelers are starting to turn those dreams of travel into actual plans. And they’re not just planning trips, they’re planning bigger, longer and more expensive trips than ever before.
Having been shut in for months on end, many would-be travelers have come to realize that the notion that you’ll make that grand safari trip to Africa “someday” has a new urgency when “someday” seems like it can’t come soon enough.
As travel writer and clinical psychologist Scott Haas put it in a post on the pointsguy.com, the stress of being unable to get out of the house during the pandemic has taken its toll. “Stress … is defined classically as, ‘no way out.’ We were afraid that the trap … was permanent. That’s how our mind works.” Hass explains, “Once the metaphorical ‘trap is sprung,’ and we discover we are free — from, say, a relationship or a global pandemic or another major stressor — “all that pent-up energy explodes.”
According to consumer advocate Christopher Elliot in a recent USA Today article, that explosion is coming in the form of an unprecedented post-COVID travel boom. “This is uncharted territory for travelers. These trips are different from the ones we used to take. Our travel dreams are bigger and richer.”
All that pent-up demand does seem to be pushing more extravagant and more pricey vacations to the top of many traveler’s lists. “When it comes to trips, they’re spending a lot more.” Mr. Elliot continues, “The average domestic trip cost has increased by 18%, to $3,587, according to the travel insurance site Squaremouth.com. The average international trip cost has grown even more — by 24% — to $4,588.”
And if you’re going to spending more money on that post-pandemic adventure, make sure you’re getting some of that cash back! Remember, as a member of The Guestbook you’ll get 5–15% cash rewards when you book directly with over 170 partner hotels and resorts across the globe.

The country which is situated in East Asia with over 51,000,000 in the population (2021) and shares a border with North Korea is truly a place worth visiting.
Just as every other country, the people of this great country have their cultural ethics, and it’s only proper that you consider these ethics when there. Here are five things you shouldn’t do when you visit the beautiful country of South Korea.

1. Giving and Collecting
While in South Korea, most of the things you need to avoid are centered on this one rule: respect.
Respect for elders is of great importance to this culture, as it is in many other cultures. It is a core requirement for natives and foreigners. When giving or receiving something to an elder (especially money) it is required of you to do so with both hands or at least have one hand support the other while at it. Failure to do so is seriously frowned upon. So if you’re in such a position and you’d love to leave a good impression, remember to give and receive with both hands.

2. Special Subway Seats
As a tourist visiting South Korea, you are most likely to take the subway to go from one point to another. It is important to note that when taking the train; you obey the most important subway rule which is to avoid the six special seats that are reserved for the elderly, disabled, and pregnant women except of course you are one.

3. Using Chopsticks
During your time in South Korea, when eating, it is important to note that eating with the chopsticks vertically from a bowl of rice is considered to attract bad luck and should be avoided by all means. This is because in most Asian cultures people only stick their chopsticks vertically in the bowl of rice only at funerals. So to avoid an awkward situation while eating with your South Korean friends, try learning how to properly eat with chopsticks.

4. Before and After Meals With Elders
As I earlier mentioned respect for elders is a priority in South Korea and it is required of a junior to wait for an elder before and after eating. That is when sharing a meal with an elder, you should never start eating before them, rather you are required to wait until they start before you do.
And when you’re done eating, no matter how full you’re feeling you should never leave the plate or the table before your elder, rather, you can stylishly eat slowly while waiting on them to be done first.

5. Female Dress Mode
Though decency can be relative, In South Korea, females are required to dress “decently”. That is they aren’t allowed to wear anything revealing that exposes their backs, shoulders, underarms, and thighs. Though you can still see some females dressed a bit revealing, it is usually frowned on in the rural parts.
Bonus:
Walking With An Elder
While in some parts of the world less attention is paid to how to walk with an elder, in South Korea, it is considered disrespectful to walk ahead of an elder. You must always walk behind when with an older person — following their steps and not following yours.
Though South Koreans are known to be quite welcoming and forgiving of foreigners who fall short of their cultural standards, you must not go there feeling high and mighty and do whatever you will. Remember the famous saying, “when in Rome, act like the Romans”. Allow me to say, when in Korea, act like the Koreans. This way, you would be showing them you truly respect and value their culture. Who would not love that?

Additionally, we continued to progress on BTP including the formal announcement of the addition of NEAR to the BTP ecosystem.
We are looking forward to launching these developments shortly. Until then, please refer to the latest progress below. 
ICON 2.0
This month, we provided an update on the development progress, timeline, and path forward for the ICON 2.0 migration. Please see the full details here.
As stated in the update, we estimate that this process can be completed by the end of August. But this timeline largely depends on how many incompatibility issues arise during the block migration process, and how hard they are to solve. Please note, it could be earlier or later than the end of August. We will keep the community updated as we progress. As of 7/31, we are at 67%.
After block import completion, we estimate that it will take around two weeks to prepare nodes and exchanges for the hard fork. At that point, ICON 1.0 will be stopped simultaneously at a predefined block height by a network proposal marking the start of the ICON 2.0 era.
Lastly, we will propose an initial IISS 3.1 update shortly. Please refer to the forum for further details and corresponding community discussions. As a reminder, this proposal will be an initial economic design for the ICON ecosystem within the ICON 2.0 framework and the addition of relayers.
BTP Ecosystem
During our final acceptance testing for Parachain integration, we found an issue of blocks not reaching finality in some extreme cases, such as hard forks that stall BTP communication with a very large accumulated message queue. While this is very unlikely to happen ever, we will not settle for almost robustness. Our teams have investigated this issue and have come up with a solution, to fragmentize the said message queue and properly process them to reach finality. This implementation is currently ongoing, and we expect to complete this task in about a week. Proceeding that will be actual integration to Moonriver (Our first Polkadot Parachain target).
Our integration to Binance Smart Chain has been going smoothly, and we have deployed a custom BSC node with the BTP contracts deployed. Our last task with BSC is the Relayer software which is close to completion as well. We will soon start testing BTP on BSC.
Lastly, our integration to Near Protocol is also full-steam ahead with BTP contract implementation. The team has also announced this on Twitter in case you missed it: click here
We continue to explore other potential integration partners. Some promising names have already expressed high interest in joining our BTP ecosystem. At this stage, it’s becoming easier to pitch and attract new partners. Soon we’ll have a working prototype, and BTP will continue to thrive.
ICE Blockchain
This month, we also provided more details on the ICE blockchain, the new EVM compatible network in the ICON ecosystem. Further details can be found here.
We will also announce additional teams to the working group very soon. Additionally, we will provide details on the testnet, snapshot for the airdrop, and other key development milestones.

Claire D. Costa', url:'https://towardsdatascience.com/10-cool-python-project-ideas-for-python-developers-7953047e203', time: 10, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*J4xsEISU9wuB237dgDfLNA.jpeg', description: 'A list of interesting ideas and projects you can build using Python', content: 'Python is one of the most used programming languages in the world, and that can be contributed to its general-purpose nature, which makes it a suitable candidate for various domains in the industry. With Python, you can develop programs not just for the web, but also for desktop and command-line. Python can be suitable for programmers of varying skill levels, right from the students to intermediate developers, to experts and professionals. But every programming language requires constant learning, and its the same case with Python.
If you truly want to get in-depth practical knowledge, there is no better way to get your hands dirty with Python than to undertake some cool projects that will not only keep you occupied in your free time but will also teach you how to get more out of Python.
Did You Know?
According to Stackoverflow, Python is the most preferred language which means that the majority of developers use python.
Choosing a Project Platform
Python can be a very versatile programming language in the right hands, and you can build many nifty programs with it to strengthen your command over the language. It is of utmost importance to have more exposure to practical knowledge than theoretical, especially when it comes to learning programming languages, such as Python.
But before we dive into the fun projects we have store for you, you must decide which platform you’re going to be working on. The platforms for the projects mentioned in this article can be categorized into three categories listed below:
● Web
Building a web application allows you and everyone else to access it from anywhere via the internet. For that, you would need to work on the front-end, the visual part, and the back-end of the application, where the business logic is implemented. Tools & Frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Web2Py are some of the many options you can use for this.
● Desktop GUI
Desktop applications are also very commonly used and cater to a sizable chunk of users. When it comes to building desktop applications, Python makes it very easy for you to develop one using its PySimpleGUI package, which allows you to build all the necessary elements using Python. The framework PyQt5 also offers advanced GUI building elements but has a steeper learning curve.
● Command-Line
Command-line programs work only in console windows and have no GUI at all. The user interaction takes place via commands and it is the oldest method of interacting with programs but don’t mistake its lack of GUI for its lack of usefulness. Hundreds of top enterprises depend on command-line programs to perform their daily business activities. To build command-line programs, you can use tools such as docopt, Python Fire, plac, and cliff.
“Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we’re looking for more people with skills in this language.”
- Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, Inc.
Python Project Ideas for Python Developers
If you have made up your mind about the platform you’re going to use, let’s jump straight into the projects. Mentioned below are some fun projects addressed towards developers of all skill levels that will play a crucial role in taking their skills and confidence with Python to the next level.
1. Content Aggregator
The internet is a prime source of information for millions of people who are always looking for something online. For those looking for bulk information about a specific topic can save time using a content aggregator.
A content aggregator is a tool that gathers and provides information about a topic from a bulk of websites in one place. To make one, you can take the help of the requests library for handling the HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing and scraping the required information, along with a database to save the collected information.
Examples of Content Aggregators:
AllTop
Hvper
2. URL Shortener
URLs are the primary source of navigation to any resource on the internet, be it a webpage or a file, and, sometimes, some of these URLs can be quite large with weird characters. URL shorteners play an important role in reducing the characters in these URLs and making them easier to remember and work with.
The idea behind making a URL shortener is to use the random and string modules for generating a new short URL from the entered long URL. Once you’ve done that, you would need to map the long URLs and short URLs and store them in a database to allow users to use them in the future.
Examples of URL Shortener 
— bit.ly
- TinyURL
3. File Renaming Tool

If your job requires you to manage a large number of files frequently, then using a file renaming tool can save you a major chunk of your time. What it essentially does is that it renames hundreds of files using a defined initial identifier, which could be defined in the code or asked from the user.
To make this happen, you could use the libraries such as sys, shutil, and os in Python to rename the files instantaneously. To implement the option to add a custom initial identifier to the files, you can use the regex library to match the naming patterns of the files.
Examples of Bulk File Rename Tools 
— Ren
- Rename

4. Directory Tree Generator
A directory tree generator is a tool that you would use in conditions where you’d like to visualize all the directories in your system and identify the relationship between them. What a directory tree essentially indicates is which directory is the parent directory and which ones are its sub-directories. A tool like this would be helpful if you work with a lot of directories, and you want to analyze their positioning. To build this, you can use the os library to list the files and directories along with the docopt framework.
Examples of Directory Tree Generators 
- Tree
- Dirtreex

5. MP3 Player
If you love listening to music, you’d be surprised to know that you can build a music player with Python. You can build an mp3 player with the graphical interface with a basic set of controls for playback, and even display the integrated media information such as artist, media length, album name, and more.
You can also have the option to navigate to folders and search for mp3 files for your music player. To make working with media files in Python easier, you can use the simpleaudio, pymedia, and pygame libraries.
Examples of MP3 Players
- MusicBee
- Foobar2000

6. Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game we’re sure each of you is familiar with. It’s a simple and fun game and requires only two players. The goal is to create an uninterrupted horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of either three Xs or Os on a 3x3 grid, and whoever does it first is the winner of the game. A project like this can use Python’s pygame library, which comes with all the required graphics and the audio to get you started with building something like this.

7. Quiz Application
Another popular and fun project you can build using Python is a quiz application. A popular example of this is Kahoot, which is famous for making learning a fun activity among the students. The application presents a series of questions with multiple options and asks the user to select an option and later on, the application reveals the correct options.
As the developer, you can also create the functionality to add any desired question with the answers to be used in the quiz. To make a quiz application, you would need to use a database to store all the questions, options, the correct answers, and the user scores.
Examples of Quiz Applications
- Kahoot
- myQuiz

8. Calculator
Of course, no one should miss the age-old idea of developing a calculator while learning a new programming language, even if it is just for fun. We’re sure all of you know what a calculator is, and if you have already given it a shot, you can try to enhance it with a better GUI that brings it closer to the modern versions that come with operating systems today. To make that happen, you can use the tkinter package to add GUI elements to your project.

9. Build a Virtual Assistant
Almost every smartphone nowadays comes with its own variant of a smart assistant that takes commands from you either via voice or by text and manages your calls, notes, books a cab, and much more. Some examples of this are Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana, and Siri. If you’re wondering what goes into making something like this, you can use packages such as pyaudio, SpeechRecognition, gTTS, and Wikipedia. The goal here is to record the audio, convert the audio to text, process the command, and make the program act according to the command.

10. Currency Converter
As the name suggests, this project includes building a currency converter that allows you to input the desired value in the base currency and returns the converted value in the target currency. A good practice is to code the ability to get updated conversion rates from the internet for more accurate conversions. For this too, you can use the tkinter package to build the GUI.

Conclusion
Concluding our list of a handful of interesting ideas and projects you can build using Python, we can say that Python can be a very useful programming language to develop applications of all sorts and scales. Furthermore, the packages provided by Python offer immense value to the developers in simplifying the development process to a great extent. To wrap things up, we would like to say that the potential with Python is limitless, and the only thing that you might be missing could be the right idea.

A Data Scientist', author: 'Megan Dibble', url:'https://megandibble.medium.com/a-data-analyst-vs-a-data-scientist-1a518b0a187', time: 4, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*noT6a8fSsHSjqD0pPaTPDg.png', description: 'Who would win in a head-to-head competition?', content: 'What’s the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?
After applying to both types of positions and then working as a data analyst for a little over a year, I have come to better understand the similarities and differences between the two roles. Depending on the company, there can certainly be slightly different definitions of a data analyst and a data scientist. This article highlights — in general — the skills which differentiate a data analyst from a data scientist as well as some of the commonalities. Oh, and I structured my analysis like a boxing match because that’s just more fun.
Ready, set, face-off!
Round 1: Data Modeling
Winner = Data Scientist
A data scientist is more focused on building predictive and prescriptive models than a data analyst. They will create machine learning models which tell stakeholders what will happen or what should be done in the business using a model, while a data analyst often stops at descriptive analytics (i.e. telling the story of what happened in the business using data).
Round 2: Data Visualization
Winner = Data Analyst
A data analyst often works with Business Intelligence (BI) tools to display data in intuitive and informative ways. They may summarize data in interactive dashboards or static reports. A data scientist, on the other hand, does not work with BI tools every day. They may create a model which generates a dataset and then hand that over to an analyst to create a visual representation of the results. Of course, if the company is small, these responsibilities could all fall to one person.
Round 3: Data Cleaning
Winner = A Tie
Both of these jobs require lots of data cleaning. The first step to drawing any meaningful conclusion from data is exploratory data analysis, wherein data must be thoroughly investigated and cleaned. (For example, checking data types of fields, looking at distributions of numeric variables, and deciding how to deal with null values.) Both people work extensively with data, so they must have some essential skill overlap.
Round 4: Coding Skills
Winner = Data Scientist
If you look at job descriptions for both of these types of roles, you will find more emphasis on knowledge of coding languages for postings with the title data scientist. A data analyst may need to know SQL and might benefit from knowing Python, but sometimes their work can be accomplished in no-code or low-code options, like using Excel or Power BI/Tableau. These solutions have limits for the amount of data you can analyze, and since you need a ton of data for predictive modeling, a data scientist will need to employ code or heavy-duty AI software (like DataRobot) to get the job done.
Round 5: Business Knowledge
Winner = Data Analyst
While it could debatably be a tie for this round, data analyst positions often can fall under many different organizations of a business. For example, there are titles like “Marketing Data Analyst” and “HR Data Analyst.” These roles are more immersed in the business than the data science team as they must employ business subject matter expertise along with their data analytics skills to succeed. Additionally, designing reporting for their stakeholders can require more business knowledge and presentation skills.
Round 6: Learning Speed
Winner = A Tie
Technology is constantly changing. No matter the title, if your job requires working frequently with data you will have to learn new tools. Additionally, both data analysts and data scientists could have to learn a lot about the issues in a certain area of the business in order to provide a data-driven solution.
So Who Wins Overall?
It’s not really a competition —companies are interested in the person who can provide value to their business. At the end of the day, the conclusions drawn from the data must be meaningful. Both of these roles are equipped to do this, just in different ways!

And, more importantly, help us to know ourselves better. But any coin has two flat sides.
There are some situations where scientific research becomes discouraging, revealing a harsh and dark side. Here are 6 such scientifically shown facts.
1 — Most people cannot live an hour without lies.
All people lie, and that’s okay. Someone does it for selfish purposes, someone — to avoid punishment, and someone — to make a pleasant surprise. But we hardly believe that people lie so often.
A 2002 study at the University of Massachusetts found that at least 60% of people lie on average two to three times during a 10-minute conversation.
86% of people regularly lie to their parents, 75% — to friends, 69% — to spouses, 40% — on resumes.
The largest percentage of lies were found in profiles on dating sites, where 90% of people admitted to lying in order to get attention.
2 — Humanity destroys nature faster than global cataclysms
Despite the general misconception that dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago, immediately after the fall of the asteroid, it took nature about 33 thousand more years to finally give way to other species.
Humanity, directly or indirectly, has become the cause of the extinction of about 60% of the species of living beings on land and at sea in the period from the 70s of the last century to the present moment.
For an extinction to be considered massive, the figure must reach 75%. Researchers say that the planet will reach this figure in the next 200 years.
But we have no doubt about the enthusiastic stupidity of human beings, which always fulfills any “five-year plan in four years.”
3 — The joy of motherhood and fatherhood is often not a joy at all.
This is a fascinating one. There is a phrase, “If God gave a bunny — he would give a lawn,” which implies that the main thing is to have children, and the rest are not problems at all.
And also, having a cute little baby is one of the biggest dreams of any couple.
German researchers decided to find out how having children affects life satisfaction. In 2015, the study was published in which more than 2 thousand childless German couples took part.
They regularly surveyed about life satisfaction before and after the birth of their first child.
It turned out that 70% of couples had a drop in overall happiness after the birth of their first child.
Interestingly, the index used by the researchers showed that life satisfaction among young parents fell dramatically — by 1.4 units. For comparison: the loss of a job lowered this index by 0.6 units and the death of a partner — by 1 unit.
4 — You will start getting stupid after 27
Club 27 is a list of famous musicians, artists, and actors who passed away too early at age 27.
Although this claim of the death of musicians at this exact age has been disproven by research several times, there is interesting research related to the exact same age.
A study from the University of Virginia found that people begin to experience cognitive decline around the age of 27.
In general, the decline is observed from the age of 22, and by about the age of 27, the deterioration of abstract thinking, brain speed, and the ability to solve puzzles begins. Finally, from about 37 years old, memory also begins to deteriorate.
5 — Wine won’t save you
A glass of red wine a day keeps the doctor away
Usually, we do not approve of taking any type of alcohol regularly. You will start with only one glass a day, and most of the time, you end up being an alcoholic.
Now more and more often, you can hear about how healthy wine is, how it reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, stroke, lowers cholesterol levels — and in general, almost a panacea for all diseases.
This beneficial effect is attributed to the resveratrol in red wine, a substance synthesized by plants as a defense against parasites such as bacteria or fungi.
Researchers from the Italian wine-growing region of Chianti decided to test the miraculous effects of wine and conducted a study that lasted 15 years. It showed that people with the highest concentration of resveratrol metabolites were just as likely to die from the same causes as those who did not have the substance in their bodies.
So the only thing you earn from an excessive love of wine is alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, and premature aging.
6 — We definitely won’t be able to explore the galaxy in the next hundred years.
Watching films like Guardians of The Galaxy, you imagined how you would fly in a spaceship to distant stars, find extraterrestrial civilizations.
However, due to the enormous scale of even our solar system, we will probably never get beyond Pluto at all.
The closest star to us, Proxima Centauri, is four light-years away. It would seem that some four years, but even on the most modern and the fastest spaceships, we will be able to get there only after 19 thousand years.
Scientists have calculated that the shortest time in which we can achieve such a development of technology in order to leave the solar system for the purpose of further colonization is 1100 years.', category: Category.fourth)

Traditional entry barriers to the field such as a lack of data and computing power have been swept aside with a continuous supply of new data startups popping up(some offering access for as little as a cup of coffee a day) and all powerful cloud computing removing the need for expensive onsite hardware. Rounding out the trinity of prerequisites, is the skill and know-how to implement, which has arguably become the most ubiquitous aspect of data science. One does not need to look far to find online tutorials touting taglines like “implement X model in seconds” , “apply Z method to your data in just a few lines of code”. In a digital world, instant gratification has become the name of the game. While improved accessibility is not detrimental on face value, beneath the dazzling array of software libraries and shiny new models, the true purpose of data science has become obscured and at times even forgotten. For it is not to run complex models for the sake of doing so, or to optimize an arbitrary performance metric, but to use as a tool to solve real world problems.
A simple but relatable example is the Iris data set. How many have used it to demonstrate an algorithm without sparing a thought for what a sepal is let alone why we measure its length? While these may seem like trivial considerations for the budding practitioner who might be more interested in adding a new model to their repertoire, it was less than trivial for Edgar Anderson, a botanist, who cataloged the attributes in question to understand variations in Iris flowers. Despite this being a contrived example it demonstrates a simple point; the mainstream has become more focused on “doing” data science rather than “applying” data science. However, this misalignment is not the cause for the decline of the data scientist but a symptom. To understand the origin of the problem we must step back and take a bird’s eye view.
Data science has the curious distinction of being one of the few fields of study that leaves the practitioner without a domain. Pharmacy students become pharmacists, law students become lawyers, accounting students become accountants. Data science students must therefore become data scientists? But data scientists of what? The broad application of data science proves to be a double edged sword. On one side, it is a powerful toolbox that can be applied to any industry where data is generated and captured. On the other, the general applicability of these tools means that rarely will the user have true domain knowledge of said industries before the fact. Nevertheless, the problem was insignificant during the rise of data science as employers rushed to harness this nascent technology without fully understanding what it was and how it could be fully integrated into their company.
However, nearly a decade later, both businesses and the environment they operate in have evolved. They now strive for data science maturity with large entrenched teams benchmarked by established industry standards. The pressing hiring demand has shifted to problem solvers and critical thinkers who understand the business, the respective industry as well as its stakeholders. No longer will the ability navigate a couple of software packages or regurgitate a few lines of code suffice, nor will a data science practitioner be defined by the ability to code. This is evidenced by the increasing popularity of no code, autoML solutions such as Data Robot, Rapid Miner and Alteryx.
What Does This Mean?
Data scientists will be extinct in 10 years (give or take), or at least the role title will be. Going forward, the skill set collectively known as data science will be borne by a new generation of data savvy business specialists and subject matter experts who are able to imbue analysis with their deep domain knowledge, irrespective of whether they can code or not. Their titles will reflect their expertise rather than the means by which they demonstrate it, be it compliance specialists, product managers or investment analysts. We don’t need to look back far to find historic precedents. During the advent of the spreadsheet, data entry specialists were highly coveted, but nowadays, as Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (the author of “Storytelling With Data”) aptly observes, proficiency with Microsoft Office suite is a bare minimum. Before that, the ability to touch type with a typewriter was considered a specialist skill, however with the accessibility of personal computing it has also become assumed.
Lastly, for those considering a career in data science or commencing their studies, it may serve you well to constantly refer back to the Venn diagram that you will undoubtedly come across. It describes data science as an confluence of statistics, programming and domain knowledge. Despite each occupying an equal share of the intersecting area, some may warrant a higher weighting than others.', category: Category.fourth)

That means I’ve been dealing with the tech market ever since, and let me tell you something, our industry hiring process is broken.
    Back in 2018, when I got my first opportunity as a developer, I was lucky enough to bump into a company that was welcoming junior developers without demanding previous experience. That leads me to our first problem: the absurd number of prerequisites asked of junior developers nowadays. How is it possible for an entry level developer to have a minimum 2 year experience with React? Let me answer that, it simply isn’t. If your company wants to hire junior developers (and they should), they must be willing to guide and teach them through this path. Junior developers are eager to learn and contribute when given the chance to do so.
    My first hiring process consisted of three parts:
    An online interview with two managers, focused mostly on my previous experience as a designer, my career path and my skills, both technical and soft;
    A take home assignment where I should develop from scratch a layout they sent me and then send it to Github for the tech team to review;
    A final on location interview for me to present my assignment to the team, explaining the project and choices of technology
    A simple, straight forward and, most important, HUMAN process.
    A few days later, on my birthday, I got a call from one of the managers offering me the job that changed my professional life.
    At the end of the year 2020 I decided it was time for a change, which led me to begin the search for my next challenge. And this is the cue to our second problem, which is precisely the hiring method I’ve began to notice and experience since then. Long, heavy and far from empathetic processes that drain our energy, makes us question our abilities and is extremely damaging to mental health.
    One of the companies I applied to demanded a 4 hour interview (among other stages) with people from different areas of the business, who frequently asked identical questions, making me repeat myself to a level of exhaustion. Another one sent me an assignment to deliver in a week using React. At the time I had zero experience with the library, but still I immersed myself in learning the technology and I delivered a beautifully coded project that makes me proud till this day. What I got in return? A final interview with a person with no tech experience, who asked rehearsed questions with no additional explanation and who gave me no technical feedback whatsoever on my assignment. It was a real bummer.
    A friend, who was looking for her second tech job at the time, took part in a process that required applicants to engage in a full workday at the company, not taking into account that most candidates are still employed while applying. The workday consisted of team ceremonies, a pair programming task with someone from the team, a conversation with the project manager and finally a talk with someone from RH. You had to be available to them for a whole day, which is impossible for most applicants.
    Beyond all these issues, there is a specific one that hunts me till the present day: the live coding interview.
    As a person who struggles with generalized anxiety disorder, I found myself at a crossroad many times, having to chose between participating in a live coding interview, even knowing that I would perform poorly and that it would affect me personally, or refusing to participate at all, closing the door to that opportunity. I believe anyone who suffers from anxiety or any kind of mental disorder can relate to this.
    Luckily for me, back then, I found myself in a comfortable position to refuse and respect my personal boundaries. And I eventually got the perfect job without having to sacrifice myself in the process. But unfortunately that’s not always the case, not for me or anyone else.
    When given the chance, I often give feedback to recruiters to try to raise awareness to this matter. It’s well received and people are often open to the conversation, but not always. A recruiter once told me that she agreed with my perspective and she brought the matter up internally, but the company wasnot willing to change.
    There is a study from the North Carolina State University along with Microsoft, that finds that the technical interviews currently used (live coding, whiteboarding) test whether a candidate has performance anxiety rather than whether the candidate is competent at coding and a right fit for the job.
    It’s also noticed that the current format excludes entire classes of candidates, like women. One of the researches responsible for the study showed that all of the women who took the public interview failed, while all of the women who took the private interview passed. And in our present scenario, where companies are striving to appear more inclusive, that should be a point of concern. When we talk about diversity and inclusion, it’s not as simple as listing a job targeting minorities. It has to go beyond the public eye. Companies need to make sure the hiring process is also inclusive and that their space is safe to welcome everyone.
    As a developer who is constantly striving to evolve, I wonder if I should adapt to fit the market, pushing my personal boundaries in favor of my career, even though I know it would be wrong.
    We shouldn’t be forced to choose between our careers and our mental health. Change should come from within the industry.
    I’m still hopeful.', category: Category.fourth)

Instead, It’s a Total Mess.', author: 'Owen Williams', url:'https://debugger.medium.com/usb-c-was-supposed-to-simplify-our-lives-instead-its-a-total-mess-626bb2ea3688', time: 4, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ySrRuOkJ8rNgqKQsQnR4Qg.jpeg', description: 'A mix of hidden standards make the ubiquitous cable a pain to deal with', content: 'Techies hailed USB-C as the future of cables when it hit the mainstream market with Apple’s single-port MacBook in 2015. It was a huge improvement over the previous generation of USB, allowing for many different types of functionality — charging, connecting to an external display, etc. — in one simple cord, all without having a “right side up” like its predecessor.
Five years later, USB-C is near-ubiquitous: Almost every modern laptop and smartphone has at least one USB-C port, with the exception of the iPhone, which still uses Apple’s proprietary Lightning port. For all its improvements, USB-C has become a mess of tangled standards — a nightmare for consumers to navigate despite the initial promise of simplicity.
Anyone going all-in on USB-C will run into problems with an optional standard called Power Delivery. The standard allows devices to charge at a much higher wattage relative to older connectors, therefore allowing them to charge faster. But it requires the right combination of charger, cables, and device to actually achieve this.
If you buy a USB-C charger that doesn’t support Power Delivery and try to use it with a Microsoft Surface, for example, the laptop will complain that it’s “not charging” despite receiving some power. Fixing this requires figuring out whether or not it’s the cable or wall charger that doesn’t support Power Delivery, and replacing it with something that does support it. There would be no way for a layperson to hold two USB-C chargers and know the difference between one that supports Power Delivery and one that doesn’t.
How any normal person is supposed to grasp this soup of standards, built atop a single port that looks the same, is anyone’s guess.
Furthering the confusion, some devices actually can’t be charged with chargers supporting Power Delivery, despite sporting a USB-C port — because they weren’t designed to negotiate the higher wattage being delivered by the Power Delivery standard. A pair of cheap Anker headphones I own, for example, refuse to charge when plugged into a MacBook charger. Other devices, like the Nintendo Switch, only partially support the standard, and some unsupported chargers have bricked devices, reportedly due to the Switch’s maximum voltage being exceeded.
Then there’s DisplayPort and Thunderbolt, another set of standards supported by some USB-C devices. DisplayPort allows the use of an external display, such as a 4K monitor, but only supports one at a time at full resolution.
Thunderbolt, yet another optional standard, is a much faster layer on top of USB-C that allows additional possibilities, like the use of multiple displays daisy-chained from a single port, or the use of an external graphics card. It uses the exact same connector, but can be identified with an additional “lightning” symbol when supported.
While DisplayPort is relatively universal on devices with USB-C ports, Thunderbolt support is a patchwork and requires both devices being plugged in to support it. Apple’s modern MacBooks support Thunderbolt, for example, but Microsoft’s new Surface Book 3 doesn’t. Monitors with Thunderbolt support also tend to be more expensive than those without, because they’re able to support more devices and additional monitors without slowing down.
If that sounds good, and you’re excited about Thunderbolt like I was recently, there’s another catch: Individual Thunderbolt ports are not equal. The standard allows for 40Gbps of throughput on the port, but some device makers only implement it partially, with 20Gbps of throughput, which limits how you’re able to use it.
Despite working in the tech industry and having a deep interest in gadgets, I tripped over this recently when trying to buy a new monitor: I wanted to be able to chain two of them off a single port and discovered that I’d not only need to buy a specific screen to achieve this (which was more expensive), but this would only work with my work MacBook Pro, and not my brand-new Surface Book 3.
How any normal person is supposed to grasp this soup of standards, built atop a single port that looks the same, is anyone’s guess. Having a single, universal port on the majority of my devices is a godsend, but it feels like spinning the wheel every time I plug something in: Will it behave the way I expect? If it’s this difficult for me, I’m not sure how the average person will know how to figure out what’s wrong.
There is some hope in the future with USB 4, which the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) announced in 2019. The new standard uses the same USB-C connector, and is actually built on top of Thunderbolt, which will help resolve a large amount of confusion and offer fast speeds universally. But, like with previous versions of USB, getting devices certified will remain optional, and there’s no clear plan for how consumers will be able to identify cables or devices that support the new standard, all of which will need to be replaced to actually use it.
I’m thankful that USB-C is becoming universal, slowly pushing us toward a future where we have a single standardized connector for everything. But it’s more confusing than ever to perform the simple act of plugging things in. When it first arrived on the scene, USB-C was pitched as a utopia: One cable to rule them all, but now that we’re living in that future, figuring out which cable is the right one when they all look the same is an unresolved nightmare.', category: Category.fourth)

It’s more acceptable than alcohol and it’s more addictive than anything you can swallow, smoke or inject, because while heroin or methamphetamine are clearly harmful, anger feels so damn righteous.
After all, that other political party is ruining the world. Their supporters hate America (or whatever country you’re in). People are too selfish. We’re not doing enough for the poor. Women don’t have enough rights. Men don’t have enough rights. Those people are racists. That group doesn’t recognise their privilege. The president is a rapist. Capitalism is exploiting everyone who isn’t the 1%.
Outrage is like a lot of other things that feel good but over time devour us from the inside out. And it’s even more insidious than most vices because we don’t even consciously acknowledge that it’s a pleasure. — Tim Kreider.
We love being angry, because it makes us feel smart. It makes us feel like we care more than the next person (who we assure ourselves doesn’t care enough), because we’re more across the facts than they are. That we have the necessary ideas to fix everything. That we’re the ones that need to be in charge. That when we call someone a Nazi, or a sexist, or a bigot, it’s not our opinion, it’s a fact. That when we call someone out or worse, try to ruin their career, they deserve it.
That’s an astounding level of arrogance.
The biggest problem with outrage, however, is that it has been weaponised. Outrage sells like crazy, because it’s a strong emotion and strong emotions force people into action. That’s why political parties, instead of coming together to find solutions, whip their supporters into a frenzy of anger against the other side. Corporations are now getting in on the action too. They weaponise your outrage to sell their products, such as Gillette with their ill fated ad campaign and Nike using Colin Kaepernick to bring socially conscious consumers to their brand.
Nike sales increased 31% after that ad was released and caused a 6 billion dollar brand increase. You think they put that ad out there to take a social stand? They used your outrage to cash in, and they cashed in big time.
The mainstream media is by far the worst culprit, however, because without your attention they don’t have a business model. They have to make you keep clicking and tuning in, otherwise their advertising dollars dry up. That’s why everything is increasingly sensationalised and it’s no longer about reporting facts. A headline that makes you emotional causes you to click. The article gets you pissed off, which sends you to the comments section to argue with people. The topic trends on social media, which you’re of course taking part in.
Rinse, repeat.
Now, rather than get on my high horse and tell you that you’re being played for a fool and you should stop participating, I’m going to take a different approach. If you’re one of those people who is constantly scrolling the news and social media, always getting angry at the latest thing you see or even worse, getting angry on behalf of other people, I’ve got a really important question:
How is it working out for you?
I honestly want to know. Has constantly reading, liking, retweeting and commenting your outrage made your life any better? What’s it actually doing for you? Has it helped you earn more at work? Be better with your family? Made you more fulfilled?
Has it accomplished anything for you whatsoever?
My guess is, it’s just made you even more pissed off and angry. And why shouldn’t it? Spending all your time getting angry about things isn’t going to make you calm and peaceful, it’s just going to result in more anger. If all you ever want to look for is the bad parts of life, how the hell are you ever going to be happy?
One of the best things I did a couple of years ago was to disconnect myself from the news, Twitter, Facebook and to click the “see fewer stories like this” button on Medium for all the articles that are just trying to stir up everyone’s emotions and piss them off. You wouldn’t believe how much more relaxed about life you become. It’s one thing to see something wrong in the world and working to change it, but what’s the point of getting outraged about things you can’t change, or have extremely limited influence over?
Here’s a better idea: use that time and energy to actively better your life and the lives of those around you. We all have a sphere of influence in our lives, where the actions we take and the words we speak actually can change things. Where we can be an example for those closest to us. If we interact and speak with the people in our immediate circle in a way that makes them feel happy, valued and important, that hopefully encourages them to make others feel the same. That’s a powerful force for good.
If you don’t do that and instead decide that you want to keep being outraged by everything, your anger is going to consume you. You’ll find that the only people that want to be around you are fellow activists and outrage addicts. The rest of us don’t want to constantly be talking about what is making you angry right now just because you think it’s the biggest deal in the world. The average person has more than enough going on in their life that they don’t need that added to it.
It’s important to remember that yes, there are more injustices than you can shake a stick at, but neither you nor anyone is going to save the world tomorrow single handedly. Your anger and martyr complex is only hurting you. I guarantee that sort of mentality is bleeding into your outside life and making you miserable. Here’s the thing — the world right now, despite all its problems, nastiness and tragedy, is far better than it was a hundred years ago. The world a hundred years ago was better than it was a hundred years before that.
In other words, the world might not be improving fast enough for you, but it’s improving every day. So here’s a free piece of advice: get off the screen, go outside and spend some time in the sun. Spend some time with friends and talk about things that make you happy. Hell, go and do some things that make you happy. You’ve got to balance things out. It’s a far more satisfying existence than spending all your time staring at a screen, fighting with people and getting worked up over problems that are probably far less urgent than they seem on social media.
The point I want to end on is probably the most important: your anger doesn’t make you right. Just because you are more angry than other people about any particular subject, it doesn’t make your opinion more valid and theirs less so. It doesn’t mean you’re some righteous warrior and they’re a piece of shit because their emotions or opinion aren’t on the same level as yours.

Here is how you can add text to your Reels for more interactive videos:
Step 1: Create a video on your phone.
Creating a video with your phone camera makes the process a whole lot easier.
Step 2: Go to your feed and click on your profile photo to add a story.
Step 3: Select Reels, and upload the video you want to edit on reels.
Step 4: Select a soundtrack.
If none of your preference is listed, then you can search for the audio you want by typing the name and the artist who created it.
Step 5: Start writing the text on the page.
Just type out the text, and we would arrange them much later. You can make gestures in your original video, so it would be easy to know where you would like them placed.
Each text would appear as a field over the timeline.
Step 6: Click on the text and set adjust the duration on the timeline to when you want the text to appear in the video and when you want it to disappear.
Because Instagram Reels allow content up to 15seconds, try not to add lengthy texts to ensure readability.
Step 7: Crosscheck to make sure the text transitions perfectly.

Jared A. Brock', url:'https://medium.com/surviving-tomorrow/facebook-is-dead-it-just-doesnt-know-it-yet-614e723e9f72', time: 8, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Unb5YuPLH6wrWYlYT2IJWQ.jpeg', description: 'The $750+ billion company still has options, but none end well', content: 'Author’s update: This article is now available en Español and 日本!
I had a strange moment last week that helped me realize that Facebook — the social media platform I’ve used for more than a decade — is about to go extinct. And, like the dodo bird and carrier pigeon, it probably doesn’t see it coming.
I have the privilege of teaching Sunday school every week (via Zoom) to a bunch of fantastic teenagers aged 14–16. They’re all digital natives with a high degree of cultural savvy, a strong distaste for anything that violates their personal privacy, and a nose for political BS.
So naturally, none of them have Facebook.
I asked if any of their friends have it. They laughed. Not a single one could think of any friends who still had Facebook. One of the boys filled me in: “Dude…Facebook is for moms and grandparents.”
In truth, the reality for Facebook is actually far worse. The megalithic social media monopoly faces five potentially insurmountable challenges in the years ahead.
1. Gen Z Doesn’t Care
The under-18s have moved on: Tik Tok. Snap. Maybe IG. They want end-to-end encryption, they don’t want to be tracked, they’re afraid of online bullying and hate speech, and they don’t like ads.
Above all, they don’t want to be on the same social networks as their moms, dads, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.
To be clear, Facebook is still the leader among under-17s, but there’s no way they’ll keep that lead for long. In fact, there are already 2.6% fewer teenagers on the site compared to Q2 2019.
Facebook could potentially roll out some sort of Facebook-for-under-18s-only, but the kids probably still wouldn’t buy it.
2. Millennials Are Ready to Ditch
More and more of my friends are cutting the royal-blue cord, especially after watching The Social Dilemma or reading eye-opening books like The Shallows, Irresistible, Hooked, or Digital Minimalism.
Because let’s face it: Facebook is a hate machine, the kind of place where negative content goes viral far more reliably than positive content. Accordingly, mindful Millennials are getting wary.
Plus: They’re now officially too old to bicker with strangers and acquaintances online, they’re not interested in having their mood manipulated, they don’t have fifty spare minutes to waste on Facebook each day, and they can securely send their child/dog/dinner photos directly to their friends and parents without the app that Zuck built.
Also? They’re discovering that they don’t need media to be social. They still remember those wonderful days of analog friendship, and once there’s a COVID vaccine, expect them to do the hard work of building up real relationships instead of media-mediated digi-connections.
All told: Expect Millennials to abandon Facebook in vast numbers as soon as a viable contender emerges.
In the meantime, many more Millennials will do what I’ve done: They’ll install Newsfeed Eradicator to kill their scrolling addiction, then they’ll install uBlockOrigin and Ghostery to block all ads and tracking.
That’ll leave them with Messenger and the ability to occasionally creep a friend’s wall when the urge arises. At that point, they’ll already have one foot out the door.
3. The Right Will Soon Walk Out en Masse
I believe that the truth should never be censored. Not in the West, not in China, not in Russia. I’ve spent five days in totalitarian North Korea — it’s a place built on lies, and I am convinced that only the truth can set us free.
That said, social media platforms have started to “censor” provable lies, patent falsehoods, blatant misdirections, and foreign clickfarm-created “news” created expressly for the purpose of fomenting disunity in the West. The truth must never be censored, but we must stand guard against egregious and verifiable lies like “the earth is flat,” “vaccines kill babies,” and “Hilary Clinton runs a child sex ring under a pizza parlor.”
This sentiment infuriates people on the far right — because after all, who gets to determine “truth”? And it’s only a matter of time before tens of millions of ultra-conservatives ditch Facebook for a new social media platform that respects their right to be deluded.
In fact, there’s already a new social media platform that’s reached number one on the app store: Parler, the so-called “Free Speech Social Network.” (We won’t point out the irony of using a foreign word to discuss keeping out foreigners.)
4. So Will the Left
In addition to the far-right abandoning Facebook for their own echo chamber, expect to see the far-left do the same. After all, is it really woke to demand income equality while using a platform that enriches a 36-year-old with a net worth north of $100 billion?
With any luck, both sets of extremists will silo up in their echo chambers and let the rest of us return the offline world to a place of winsome, respectful, highly-productive civil discourse.
5. What’s Left Won’t Be Worth Keeping
The Gen Zers ditch, the Millennials ditch, the far-left ditches, the far-right ditches, and what remains? A boring, bloated middle. Near-nil cutting-edge content creators. The user base will be a bunch of non-political sixty-somethings who like cat pictures and dancing dog videos, plus a few trolls with too much time on their clammy hands.
You thought Myspace was bad? In five years, Facebook could be the most depressing place on the Internet.
So What’s Facebook to Do?
They have options:
Lean into their fastest-growing demographic: senior citizens. It’s not sexy, but heck, have you seen what Viagra commercials sell for? Obviously, there is nothing wrong with catering to Baby Boomers, but our youth-obsessed society will no longer see them as the leading platform if they do.
Lean no-holds-barred into clash-politics and clickbait conspiracy theories and ruin the world.
Invest a metric ton of cash in trying to convince the next generation that Facebook’s still the cool kid on the block, despite their aging platform and serious privacy concerns.
Keep acquiring real innovators like Instagram and WhatsApp (ie TikTok). This will certainly work in the short-term… until a barrage of anti-monopoly lawsuits breaks them all up again.
All of this inevitably leads to Facebook’s collapse.
That’s Impossible!
No, it’s not. While Facebook isn’t going away anytime soon — it still has over two billion daily active users — if Myspace taught us anything, it’s that when the world’s biggest social media site collapses, it effectively does so overnight.
It’s the Network Effect, but in reverse.
For those unfamiliar with Metcalfe’s Law, the theory posits that “the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. As the physical cost of the network grows linearly, its value grows exponentially.”
Let’s assign everyone a value of 1.5. A network of 2 people is worth 2.25 (1.5 x 1.5). A network of 3 people isn’t worth 3— it’s worth 3.375. Facebook’s network of two billion is worth $750,000,000,000.
It’s we, the collective users, are what gives Facebook 100% of its value. The reality is that when my eight closest friends quit Facebook or switch platforms, I’ll never log in again.
While Facebook’s deflation may take longer than others due to its massive size — and, like Myspace, it will certainly continue to exist for decades in some form — it’s safe to say that its best days are in the past. Because it’s only a matter of time before the network effect breaks down.
Good News: Opportunities Abound
In the end, Facebook’s demise will actually be very good news for marketers, entrepreneurs, social media users, and the public at large.
For marketers, more platforms give more marketing options, more niche specificity, and less ad competition.
For entrepreneurs, there’s the opportunity to build bona fide, elegant, innovative Facebook challengers for the first time in a decade. As individualist-consumerist society grows, expect to see a proliferation of niche-specific sites in the years ahead. (And, perhaps ironically, some sort of master-site to access them all from a single app.)
For social media users, expect (or demand) to see the introduction of a User’s Bill of Rights, including beefed-up privacy standards, far-less addictive algorithms, innovative protection from foreign trolling, and perhaps even ad revenue sharing… go Medium! It’s our presence and content creation that gives these platforms all their power and profit, and it’s time they start treating us more like customers and contributors and less like the product being sold.
For the public at large, spreading our digital interactions across a larger swath of sites could lead to better protection of our data, some inventive weapons in the fight against the foreign interference that undermines democracy and civil discourse, and a non-monopolized ecosystem of diverse platforms from which to express real truths without censorship.
Perhaps we can fix this thing after all.

On Thursday afternoon, Facebook banned the group on the basis of attempting to delegitimize the election process, and for its role in potentially instigating physical violence.
“In line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group ‘Stop the Steal,’ which was creating real-world events. The group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group,” a Facebook spokesperson told OneZero.
For two days, the group promoted baseless claims about election fraud, such as the conspiracy theory that Trump votes were being discarded.
The group was reportedly started by Women for America First, a conservative nonprofit founded by political activist Amy Kremer and her daughter, Kylie, according to Reuters.
Women for America First shared fundraising callouts to the group, claiming the money would be used for “boots on the ground” efforts in key battleground states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. It’s unclear how much money the nonprofit has raised as a result of the Facebook group.
“We need help for flights, gas, and hotels,” the nonprofit wrote in a post shared to Stop the Steal.
Several smaller groups identically named “Stop the Steal” remain on the platform, however. In one such group, an administrator warned members to “Please keep content as appropriate as possible. Venting frustrations is okay. No threats. Use IMAGES with WORDS instead of text to help secure your message. No things regarding the alphabet letter (Q). We have MEWE for that.”
Some of these groups are now creating backups on MeWe, a platform that markets itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook. OneZero previously reported that U.S. militia groups were using MeWe to organize ahead of the election.
Members of these groups are also sharing content generated off-platform, such as a Substack post titled “5 things you can do now to #StopTheSteal” that encourages people to “Participate in citizen journalism by monitoring and documenting ballot counting.”
Mobs of Trump supporters have already descended on vote-counting centers in states like Arizona and Michigan, in some cases demanding that votes stop being counted despite the fact that Trump is currently behind Vice President Biden.', category: Category.fifth)

I don’t want to be that guy. I’m enthusiastic about the whole world moving online and the benefits of remote work. I believe we can push forward as a society, gradually getting better and kinder.
But I also witness how our current society rewards certain toxic behaviors. And this is especially true for those who spend a lot of time online.
Let’s talk about those traits we’d be better off without.
1. Repression
Sometimes we pretend that self-repression is a thing of the past. Many old social taboos are gone, but that doesn’t always mean we understand ourselves well.
For example, take the fear of death. It used to be a natural part of life as several generations lived together and helped each other out. But over time, we’ve all become distant from each other. COVID-19 really brought home how much we’ve been avoiding topics like sickness, aging, and also grief and death.
Once we stop repressing our fear, we can start accepting it. We can stop living our lives as though we are immortal. Without repression, we can embrace the day instead. Isn’t that so much better than constantly fleeing from our own feelings?
2. Shallowness
The world has sped up — we can all agree that that’s true. It’s impacting the way we treat each other and the things we think about.
Do we really need to know about what’s going on in the world every day? Keep tabs on which celebrities date whom? Watch the latest hot show on Netflix and forget about it the next day?
We know that Fear of Missing Out leads to increased loneliness and depression. But it’s still hard to break out of that need to know everything. Nobody wants to look silly in a dinner conversation, and we’re also tempted to try to one-up people with our collection of useless facts. So we’ve developed a thirst for shallow information and entertainment.
I’m not saying we should all start reading classics by candlelight (as peaceful as that sounds). But there’s much to be gained about enjoying books and movies with more substance. When I put in that kind of effort, it fills up a void I’m not aware of usually, and my FOMO fades away.
3. Intellectual Arrogance
Being shallow about art isn’t the worst thing in the world. It’s far more worrying that people take the same approach to the news. Instead of looking at what’s true and important, we often notice only the flashiest, most shocking news items.
To be fair, there’s a lot of information out there, and it’s hard for anyone to navigate. I keep thinking about that one Noam Chomsky quote:
“You can’t expect somebody to become a biologist by giving them access to the Harvard University biology library and saying, “Just look through it.” That will give them nothing. The internet is the same, except magnified enormously.”
We have never had this much access to knowledge… and people are sinking into willful ignorance at alarming rates. Many fall for conspiracy theories, while others latch onto their favorite pundit’s opinion and refuse to hear other viewpoints.
There’s no easy answer to the problem of finding good information, but a bit of intellectual humility would go a long way. As Epictetus said:
“Be content to appear stupid or clueless in extraneous matters. Don’t wish to seem knowledgeable — and if some regard you as important, distrust yourself.”
Don’t fall for easy answers and don’t pretend you understand things you don’t. The only way to gain knowledge is to stop showing off and do your own research. Even more importantly, work on your self-knowledge. That way, you won’t fall prey to grifters.
4. An Addiction to Anger
While we’re at it, we need to work on our emotional resilience. It’s all too easy to fall for a herd mentality, especially when it comes to strong emotion. I keep watching people get swept up in a tidal wave of outrage, and sometimes I’m tempted to do the same.
Anger is a poisonous emotion. It is also very easy to redirect. You’re angry at yourself, at your boss or your spouse or the life circumstances you’re stuck in. But you don’t want to actually deal with any of that, so you direct all your anger on some topic that doesn’t affect you at all.
Now you’re thinking, “But Eric! There’s so much injustice in the world, why shouldn’t I get angry about it?”
Sure, that’s true. But are you using your anger to really help anything? Or are you just indulging in it because it makes you feel important? It’s an adrenaline rush, getting to yell at somebody online, especially when you get to feel righteous about it too.
5. Cruelty
If you haven’t heard of Myka Stauffer, she’s a Youtuber who gained notoriety last year after she and her husband “re-homed” a child she had adopted from China. The little boy was autistic, and the Stauffers decided they didn’t want to have him in their family anymore. It probably didn’t help that he wasn’t as easy to film as their other children. Myka kept getting frustrated with him for ruining her brand as a parenting influencer.
The story was infuriating. Now there’s that adrenaline rush I was talking about just now — I succumb to it too sometimes!
But it was also a good example of the casual cruelty that’s becoming standard today. We’re treating other people as expendable.
Is it good for any kid to have all their moments recorded and shared online? Nope. But parents do it anyway, and they don’t care about the consequences.
It’s not just parents who are prey to this. There’s been a rise in animal cruelty perpetuated for likes and views. Sometimes, people don’t even realize they’re abusing the animal — they’re simply ignorant and don’t stop to think about what they’re doing.
That’s not even getting into how badly we treat each other. Social media increases narcissism and decreases compassion, and it seems to be getting worse each year. Cruelty is rewarded with engagement and attention — and we’re increasingly desperate for both.
Is There a Solution?
I don’t think there’s an easy way to solve any of these problems. Social media isn’t going anywhere, and the damage it’s done is already here.
All we can do is try to maintain some clarity. Avoid time-wasters, disengage from the outrage, and step away from stupid arguments.
My personal motto is: Cut the crap. That’s what I tell myself when I notice I’m being dishonest (toward others, and more importantly toward myself).
As long as I can hold on to who I am, I think I’ll be fine.

The woman learned that she would be taking part in an “aesthetic judgment” experiment. The researchers took a photograph of her face and then asked her to sit at a table that held two objects: a computer monitor and a mirror.
On the monitor, the woman viewed a series of headshots of what the study termed “attractive professional models” — all of them women. Following this barrage of beautiful faces, the woman’s own photograph appeared on the screen. But it wasn’t just a single photo; the woman saw 13 pictures of herself scattered across the monitor. Looking closely, she could see that each version of her face was different from all the others.
Using a specially designed photo-editing program, the researchers had taken the woman’s photograph and created “morphs” — copies manipulated to make the woman appear either more or less attractive. Along with her original headshot, the woman was now looking at eight photographs that airbrushed and otherwise enhanced her appearance — dramatically, in some cases — and four photographs that marred her looks.
With the mirror to guide her, the woman was instructed to pick out her true image from the false ones. Even though the complimentary headshots outnumbered the adulterated ones by a two-to-one margin, the woman selected one of the unflattering photographs as the most authentic representation of what she saw in the mirror.
The researchers repeated versions of this experiment with roughly 70 other men and women. Over and over again, the people who looked at lineups of beautiful faces tended to select self-portraits that had been manipulated to look less attractive.
On the other hand, when the researchers flipped the script and showed people unattractive faces, those people tended to view their own faces more favorably.
Since the inception of social-comparison theory in the early 1950s, psychologists and sociologists have piled up evidence that human beings form opinions of themselves — their looks, aptitude, intelligence, and achievement — based in large part on the qualities they see in the people with whom they identify and associate. When those comparisons lead to inaccurate self-representations or appraisals, this distortion is sometimes referred to as the “frog-pond effect.”
The phrase stems from a 1966 paper that found college students at elite universities who had low GPAs tended to view their own academic abilities less favorably than students at lower-tier colleges who had good GPAs. “It is better to be a big frog in a small pond than a small frog in a big pond,” the author of that paper wrote.
The “frog-pond effect” continues to show up in research today.
“We use the term ‘frog-pond effect’ as shorthand for this tendency of people with a high rank in a low-rank group to evaluate themselves more favorably than people with a low rank in a high-rank group,” says Ethan Zell, PhD, author of the PLOS One study and an associate professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.
“These effects are magnified when we’re comparing ourselves to people we view as peers.”
In other words, we look at other people as a frame of reference when we are evaluating ourselves. While “upward” social comparisons can make us feel less attractive, less capable, or otherwise inferior, “downward” social comparisons tend to have just the opposite effect. “These effects are magnified when we’re comparing ourselves to people we view as peers, or those in a similar situation to ourselves,” Zell explains.
It’s difficult to overstate the role that social comparison plays in our lives, perhaps especially when we’re young or vulnerable.
Research has found that all of us engage in social comparisons — consciously or unconsciously — dozens and perhaps hundreds of times each day. To one extent or another, these comparisons influence every facet of our well-being and behavior, from our confidence and self-regard, to our willingness to take risks, to the likelihood that we’ll develop anxiety or depression.
Upward social comparison is not inherently harmful. “It can inspire us to take better care of ourselves, or to be ambitious in positive ways,” Zell says. But like anything else, too much of it can cause problems.
Unfortunately, modern life may overwhelm us with comparisons that distort our self-image and so threaten our well-being.
Inthe context of social media, the “highlight reel” effect describes people’s tendency to put only their best, most-flattering selves online. There’s mounting evidence, especially among young people, that the more time we spend looking at these glamorized depictions of others, the more the frog-pond effect and upward social comparisons do a number on our egos.
“Social media and technology have really expanded the reach of comparisons,” Zell says. Like the young woman in his study whose self-assessment took a hit after she viewed beautiful faces, many of us can’t help but feel inferior when we’re exposed to image after image or post after post of people who seem cooler, more interesting, funnier, prettier, or more stylish than we are.
“When we’re surrounded by people we view as somehow better than us — even if objectively we’re above average — that can be really demoralizing or deflating,” Zell explains.
Social media influencers may be especially damaging to our self-appraisals. We tend to view these people as peers, rather than what they really are — minor celebrities who are often paid handsomely to project a certain image or lifestyle. We may hear about their bad days or insecurities, but the overall message our brain is receiving is “this is a better version of me.”
“Changing our attention from the things we do not have to an appreciation of thing we do have may protect humans from the dangers of social comparisons.”
Before social media, most of our comparisons were based on face-to-face interactions with friends, schoolmates, co-workers, and those who occupied our real-world social spheres. We saw the good and the bad — the features and the flaws — in something closer to equal measure. And this helped properly calibrate our self-assessments.
There’s also evidence that, in offline contexts, we frequently downplay our shiniest attributes. Research has found that being the target of an upward social comparison is unpleasant for us, and so we tend to shift our behavior in an effort to better mesh with our peers. “We can sense when other people feel bad because we’re better off than them and we adjust, but that doesn’t seem to be the case on social media,” Zell explains.
All of this suggests that limiting your exposure to online sources of upward social comparison may pay all sorts of dividends. In the infinitely large pond that is the internet, almost all of us are going to end up feeling like small frogs.
There’s also evidence that gratitude practices are an effective countermeasure against negative self-appraisals.
Research has found that while social comparisons often trigger a sense of deprivation and all the negative feelings that attend it, gratitude has just the opposite effect. “Changing our attention from the things we do not have to an appreciation of thing[s] we do have may protect humans from the dangers of social comparisons,” wrote the authors of a 2019 study in Frontiers in Psychology.
Two gratitude practices seem to be especially helpful.
First, write down in a journal what you’re thankful for. Focus on people and positive social interactions, rather than personal achievements or possessions. “Reflect back on your day and think of the people you met and interacted with and are grateful for,” counsel the authors of a 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Psychology. Doing this three times a week was associated with measurable improvements in well-being and positive affect, that study found.
Second, take time to tell the people in your life why you’re grateful for them.
“Expressing gratitude is really, really important because it helps us to overcome self-serving bias,” says Robert Emmons, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, and a leader in the field of gratitude research. “Grateful people are absorbed by the good that others are doing for them, and they don’t keep silent about it.”
We can’t switch off our social-comparison tendencies. But with a little effort, we can recalibrate them.

This is part of Twitter’s relatively new fact-checking initiative. Facebook has its own program for this as well.
Social media is spiraling out of control and desperately needs to be reeled back in, but how much of this is the user’s responsibility vs the platforms? Should platforms and their third-party partners be policing the content being shared or should users be more accountable?
Why platforms are censoring content
We’re in a truly exciting, yet terrifying era with the internet. The internet turns 30 next year! In the 30 years the internet has been publicly available, we’ve seen and experienced so many wonderful things. Commerce has completely transformed. Human interaction and dating have changed forever (swipe right if you see me!) Music has transitioned from physical to digital. I’ve made a lot of friends who I’ve never met in person due to video games. Our quality of life has increased significantly because of the internet!
As the internet became accessible to more people, it became a vehicle to influence people and to do evil. Social media went from being the place to connect with friends and family to becoming the battlefield for citizens to assemble and organize a civil war. It also became the battleground for governments to fight back against citizens.
A prime example of this is the Syrian Civil War. As a note, Facebook was banned in Syria in 2007 as part of an effort to crackdown on political activism. Syrian’s were able to get around the ban by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) which can show you’re browsing the internet from a different country. You might use it to stream better shows on Netflix, others might use it to plan a civil war.
Anyways, the online conflict emerged in 2011 when organizers Syrian citizens began organizing peaceful protests via Facebook. President Bashar al-Assad responded with tanks. A group of pro-Assad activists dubbed the Syrian Electronic Army fought back with a series of DDoS attacks, phishing scams, and more. Activists in Syria were genuinely concerned that the government was tracking their activity on websites like Facebook and Twitter to punish them later. “I am too scared to speak about my political activity on Facebook,” said a 21-year-old activist, who asked to be referred to as Rana. Reuters did an incredible breakdown of this entire topic here. In short, the internet became a tool to instill fear in citizens and a resource to track down anyone who was against the government in power.
If we fast forward to 2016, we can see how a lack of fact-checking measures affected the outcome of the election. I wrote about this in a previous article.
The Cambridge Analytica x Facebook scandal changed the trajectory of this nation for generations. It provided the Trump campaign with the raw data of 87 million Facebook profiles that, in the hands of the right marketing team, could be used to influence and win an election. An election that put Donald Trump in charge of appointing 200 federal judges including two Supreme Court justices with the potential for more should he be reelected. These judges will shape the rule of law in America for generations.
With what we’ve learned about the 2016 presidential election and what’s been well documented in The Great Hack, we have a really strong case for fact-checking the content on these platforms now more than ever.
And fast forward to 2020… In the case of President Trump, it really makes sense. Trump is attempting to subvert democracy and prevent the peaceful transition of power with baseless allegations of voter fraud. The Trump campaign has regularly promoted and shared altered content to fit their narrative.
Trump is currently calling votes illegal after being projected to lose the election. He is doing everything in his power to stir up his voters for support and exhausting every legal option he has available to him. Twitter is censoring his tweets by adding warnings and requiring users to click the “view” button to see the tweets.
In this context, I think it makes sense. These are bold and dangerous claims that absolutely need to be taken with a full fistful of salt. But what if platforms like Google, Facebook & Twitter abuse this power to silence people who don’t follow the mainstream narrative? Should they wield this much power?
Who is doing the fact-checking and can we trust them to be unbiased?
Facebook, Instagram, and Google have been working with third-party fact-checking organizations that are certified through the non-partisan International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) to moderate and throttle content being spread on their platforms. Facebook has broken down its approach to fact-checking here.
Who is fact-checking the fact-checkers? The big flaw here is that humans are part of the equation and humans are inherently biased.
Is it the responsibility of platforms to fact check the content being circulated? Absolutely. President Trump has vehemently pushed for platforms to be held responsible for the content on their platforms and is aiming to repeal Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Is repealing CDA 230 the answer? Absolutely not.
We need another viable solution because these platforms have benefited greatly from selling our data and manipulating us for profit — even if it wasn’t done maliciously. They crafted the tools for provocateurs to manipulate the masses and as a result, they now have the responsibility to moderate their platforms. I love capitalism and the free market. This is probably the first time I’ve ever thought government regulation would be a good thing.
What are your rights online?
Now we have to ask… What are your rights online? We’re in the Wild Wild West era of the internet. In short — you don’t really have rights. Your freedom of speech doesn’t apply here. On the internet, the platform you use is just another governing body. They determine what is allowed and what isn’t. And much like the government, they have investors to appease.
Despite the majority of social media platforms coming from the United States, they do not have to uphold the constitution. In general, private enterprise shouldn’t. But in some cases, Facebook can restrict certain content to comply with local laws. For example, Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany so if it’s reported, the content will be restricted for people in Germany. You can read more about the policy here.
Non-profit organizations like Public Citizen are actively working towards building a framework for comprehensive privacy protection and digital rights in the United States. Their goal is to protect our privacy by way of a data protection agency. They have outlined the failures of our current system and their vision for a US Data Protection Agency here. In theory, this can be great but it’s still just an idea.
In 2018, the European Union implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which regulates the processing of personal data and how it is controlled. It is one of the first major steps towards securing rights for individuals on the web.
Earlier this year, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which gives residents the right to know what personal data is being collected, whether it’s been sold or disclosed, the ability to say no to the sale of their data, and more.
Steps are certainly being taken in the right direction, but we need a global solution instead of a regional one.
Does big tech need to be broken up?
Again, I’m a big believer in capitalism and letting the market regulate but it’s become clear that these companies have grown too big and become too powerful. It mirrors what has been going on in China for years. China has its own Amazon by way of Alibaba. Facebook/ Instagram/ WhatsApp/ Messenger are all bundled into WeChat which is owned by Tencent.
Companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon effectively own the internet. These companies are currently at the center of antitrust hearings from the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for their anti-competitive practices.
Remember when Snapchat chose not to sell to Facebook and then Facebook took all of Snapchat’s features and added it to Instagram? Or when Facebook took TikTok’s features and created Instagram Reels? At the end of the day, Facebook is just aping WeChat at every turn, but that’s a conversation for another day.
Instagram just published their new Terms of Service in which they disclose how they’re using your phone to spy on you. They revealed how they use your phone number, your IP address, and information about nearby devices. This means computers, smart TVs, or anything else connected to your wireless network. The app knows where you live and where you go. They can view and analyze things through your front camera, make a copy of your address book, call log, and text history.
Instagram also took things a step further with their new terms to make things harder for sex workers which have consistently been targeted on the web over the years. Sarah Osei of High Snobiety outlines the war on sex workers really well here. With the new terms of service, anything deemed sexual can be flagged and have your account removed. Don’t you dare drop an eggplant, peach or water drop emoji in your caption ever again.
Instagram is now worse than TikTok.
What happens when these platforms work together?
Things can get exponentially worse when these companies align and take a hit out on influential people who don’t play by their rules. They can work in tandem to deplatform these people. It happened to Alex Jones.
Let me make it crystal clear — I am not endorsing or supporting Alex Jones in any capacity. I’m trying to paint a picture of the power these companies wield.
“On Aug. 5, Apple removed several Alex Jones-affiliated podcasts from iTunes. Over the next 48 hours, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, Mailchimp, the radio broadcaster Stitcher, and even Pinterest followed suit. Twitter eventually banned Jones after a short and awkward controversy, in which the company’s CEO Jack Dorsey tried and failed to defend his decision not to ban him earlier. In September, PayPal also dropped InfoWars.” Read more about his deplatforming here. On the Joe Rogan podcast, Alex Jones claimed that the banks marked him with a hate symbol which designated him as an international terrorist. Five out of six of his bank accounts were frozen.
His assets were frozen and his business peddling conspiracies and snake oil were shut down in a coordinated hit. If they can work in tandem to strip away his ability to earn a living, they can do it to anyone else.
Even major businesses like PornHub are victims to the bullying of these tech companies. Creators can’t run ads that lead users to PornHub. And just two weeks ago, Visa & MasterCard dropped payment processing for PornHub at the same time until PornHub deleted all unverified content from the platform. PornHub can’t collect payment Visa & MasterCard just dictated what kind of porn you can watch.
Toe the line or start looking for decentralized solutions.
What are the alternatives to big tech? Parler? Bitcoin? A decentralized future.
Big tech is inescapable. I’ve come to terms with that. Freedom & privacy on the internet is gone. While there are alternatives to big tech, they aren’t really financially viable because so many companies are dependent on ad revenue. Companies, blogs, retailers, and content creators all need to publish content that can be monetized so they can survive.
New social media platforms like Parler have popped up recently and have been promising free speech and less censorship. But how will they monetize this? “Our business model is going to be an ad revenue model. The idea of how we’re going to do it isn’t going to be a centralized model for ads, it will be specific around influencers. So advertisers will target influencers and those people with a large reach, rather than us as a platform,” John Matze, CEO and founder of Parler. The platform is controversial as it has become a place for Trump supporters to hang out without fear of scrutiny but I welcome the competition. I’m curious to see how long the platform lasts — not because of its user base but because of how they’re choosing to monetize the platform.
Alex Jones is turning to Bitcoin. PornHub is turning to Bitcoin. Even PayPal is embracing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an answer to a lot of the banking issues because it’s a decentralized digital currency. There is no central bank and no one to answer to. And maybe this is what we need more of. Companies are too powerful. Every ounce of our privacy has been sold — we are constantly being tracked. The internet is no longer free.', category: Category.fifth)

The first time i experienced a paywall is when I was reading Medium articles.
Big newspaper sites like The Washington Post, the New York Times, BusinessInsider, and almost every online publishing site started introducing their own paywall. Some of the newspaper sites like the New York Times give you the opportunity to read a limited number of articles for free on a monthly basis.
Why I am writing this article? I am writing to help students and those people who can’t afford the subscription charges. I have made some videos related to bypass newspaper sites and read articles for free and a lot of students and poor folks thank me for making such videos. You can watch videos like;
Disclosure: Some links mentioned in this article are affiliate links this means we will make a small commission, with no extra cost to you, if you choose to buy a service or product through our links. Thank you!
Before you go to the process, you can check out the links and buy a digital subscription to these platforms;
Check out the New York Times Digital Subscription
Check out the Wall Street Journal DIgital subscription

Ever heard of ad-wall, it is like Paywalls for those people who have ad-blocks installed. I believe this is very unethical to consume content and don’t see ads because that is in your control, you might be poor like me, I am a student, but you could allow and take time to see and check out ads. If you have an ad-blocker installed then you should un-installed it right now.

How to get around almost any newspaper paywalls
In this article, I will show you guys five ways to get around newspaper paywalls and read articles for free without paying to any site.
1. Using the Incognito window
This one is very easy. You just have to click on the article you want to read and copy its URL and open an incognito window and paste the link and boom, you are now reading the article and bypassing it. This is true for reading Medium.com articles for free. Actually, the good thing about using the incognito window for reading articles is that your history isn’t traced. You can also use this method of reading articles for free in the new york times and all those newspaper sites that give you the opportunity to read a limited number of articles for free.

2. Using a VPN to bypass newspaper paywalls
VPN gives you a virtual proxy address which helps you to bypass newspaper sites as they can’t track your IP address and you could connect and disconnect your VPN many times so that after every connection you get another IP address.
3. Cleaning your browser history
This is the same for every other type of bypass newspaper paywall method. You can clean your browsing history or cache to read unlimited articles. You can perform this process in the New York Times and all those sites like Medium which gives a free reading for months. Your browsing history is recorded and the site doesn’t allow you to read the articles for this purpose you need to clean your browser history and try again to read newspaper articles for free.
4. Joining the free 1-month trial
There are a lot of sites like the New York Times, Financial Times, and The Washington Post that give you an opportunity to read unlimited articles for one-month if you submit your credit card information and sign-up. This is one of the best ways to read newspaper articles for 1 month for free and then you could cancel.
But, obviously, this isn’t a permanent solution to the permanent and my most favorite way to bypass newspaper articles is by using a chrome extension we mentioned in the method-5 to bypass any newspaper site paywall.
5. [Powerful] Install Bypass Chrome Paywall Extension to bypass newspaper sites and read it for free
How about this? You just have to install a chrome extension and you could read almost every major newspaper site and bypass its paywall without doing anything. It is like an ad-blocker. I personally use this method to read unlimited articles in newspaper publication for free.
The step-by-step method to Install Bypass chrome paywall extension:
Go to Google and type “Bypass paywall chrome extension”
Click on the first search result to appear.
Click on the “Code” and then Download the code as a ZIP file.
Now, you have to unzip the folder. Unzip the folder and remember the address or the folder you have placed the folder.
Then, you have to go to chrome and type chrome://extensions and make the developer mode on.
Click on “load unpack” and copy the folder we have Unzipped.
Boom, now you can read paywall-based articles for free.
I hope this article will help you bypass any newspaper paywall and read paywall-based articles for free.

They turned out to be eerily prescient.
By Matt Weinberger
In 1999, Bill Gates wrote a book titled “Business @ the Speed of Thought.” In it Gates made 15 predictions that at the time might have sounded outrageous.
But as Markus Kirjonen, a business student, said on his blog, Gates’ forecasts turned out to be eerily prescient.
Here are the 15 predictions Gates made more than 20 years ago — and how close they’ve come to being true.
Eugene Kim and Biz Carson contributed to earlier versions of this article.
1) Price-comparison sites
Gates’ prediction: “Automated price comparison services will be developed, allowing people to see prices across multiple websites, making it effortless to find the cheapest product for all industries.”
What we see now: You can easily search for a product on Google or Amazon and get different prices. Sites like Kayak and Expedia help people find the cheapest price for a flight, while Google Shopping and Microsoft’s Bing Shopping help find bargains for everything else.
2) Mobile devices
Gates prediction: “People will carry around small devices that allow them to constantly stay in touch and do electronic business from wherever they are. They will be able to check the news, see flights they have booked, get information from financial markets, and do just about anything else on these devices.”
What we see now: Smartphones, smartwatches, speakers like the Amazon Echo, and even headsets like the Microsoft HoloLens give users a way to have all their information on hand at all times.
3) Instant payments and financing online — and better healthcare through the web
Gates’ prediction: “People will pay their bills, take care of their finances, and communicate with their doctors over the internet.”
What we see now: Tech hasn’t been able to change healthcare the way Uber changed transportation, but sites like ZocDoc aim to make finding a doctor and scheduling easier. Startups like One Medical and Forward are trying to change what the doctor’s office is like by offering monthly memberships for online and data-driven healthcare. Plus, big HMOs like Kaiser Permanente now offer video-chat medical consultations via smartphone.
You can also now borrow money online through sites like Lending Club and easily make payments through sites and apps like PayPal and Venmo.
4) Personal assistants and the Internet of Things
Gates’ prediction: “‘Personal companions’ will be developed. They will connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data. The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up. It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you’re doing.”
What we see now: Virtual voice assistants like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa are moving in this direction, offering a personalized way to get your information just by asking for it out loud. Meanwhile, smart devices like Nest’s flagship thermostat collect data on your daily routines and automatically adjust your house’s temperature.
5) Online home monitoring
Gates’ prediction: “Constant video feeds of your house will become common, which inform you when somebody visits while you are not home.”
What we see now: This is increasingly common. Companies like Canary, Amazon’s Ring, Netgear, and Google cousin Nest all make cameras that let you view the feed from your phone, and that send a push alert when there’s a human in view.
6) Social media, category: Category.fifth)
Gates’ prediction: “Private websites for your friends and family will be common, allowing you to chat and plan for events.”
What we see now: “Private websites” didn’t quite happen. But Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, Line, Slack, and plenty of other apps give you an easy way to keep in contact with groups large and small.
7) Automated promotional offers
Gates’ prediction: “Software that knows when you’ve booked a trip and uses that information to suggest activities at the local destination. It suggests activities, discounts, offers, and cheaper prices for all the things that you want to take part in.”
What we see now: Travel sites like Expedia and Kayak offer deals based on a user’s past purchase data. Google and Facebook can offer promotional ads based on the user’s location and interests. Airbnb, which lets people stay in homes rather than hotels, offers specialized trips at destinations so you can live like a local, too.
8) Live sports discussion sites
Gates’ prediction: “While watching a sports competition on television, services will allow you to discuss what is going on live, and enter a contest where you vote on who you think will win.”
What we see now: Facebook and Twitter are where sports fans go to discuss the big game as it happens. The two social networks have even dabbled in streaming pro sports directly from their sites. Facebook aired some MLB games, while Twitter streamed select NFL and MLS matches.
9) Smart advertising
Gates’ prediction: “Devices will have smart advertising. They will know your purchasing trends, and will display advertisements that are tailored toward your preferences.”
What we see now: Just look at the ads you see on Facebook or Google — the online advertising industry hinges on the ability of these services to target ads that are, in theory, personalized to your demographic and interests.
10) Links to sites during live TV
Gates’ prediction: “Television broadcast will include links to relevant websites and content that complement what you are watching.”
What we see now: Almost every commercial these days has a callout asking the viewer to go to a website, follow the business on Twitter, or a scan a QR code. It’s rare to see a broadcast without a website linked at all.
11) Online discussion boards
Gates’ prediction: “Residents of cities and countries will be able to have internet-based discussions concerning issues that affect them, such as local politics, city planning, or safety.”
What we see now: Beyond what Facebook and Twitter already offer in terms of political discussion, apps like Nextdoor and Citizen are aimed at helping neighborhood denizens connect with each other and discuss local issues.
12) Interest-based online sites
Gates’ prediction: “Online communities will not be influenced by your location, but rather, your interest.”
What we see now: All kinds of news sites and online communities focus on single topics. Many news sites have expanded to include separate verticals, offering more in-depth coverage on a given topic. Reddit is a great example of a website that’s divided into subgroups, or subreddits, that focus on interests rather than who you know or where you are.
13) Project-management software
Gates’ prediction: “Project managers looking to put a team together will be able to go online, describe the project, and receive recommendations for available people who would fit their requirements.”
What we see now: Tons of workflow software in the enterprise space, including Slack, Asana, and Trello, are revolutionizing how people recruit, form teams, and assign work to others. Meanwhile, companies like Fiverr and Gigster help connect companies with the creative talent they need to get a project accomplished.
14) Online recruiting
Gates’ prediction: “Similarly, people looking for work will be able to find employment opportunities online by declaring their interest, needs, and specialized skills.”
What we see now: Sites like LinkedIn allow users to upload résumés and find jobs based on interests and needs, and recruiters can search based on specialized skills.
15) Business community software
Gates’ prediction: “Companies will be able to bid on jobs, whether they are looking for a construction project, a movie production, or an advertising campaign. This will be efficient for both big companies that want to outsource work that they don’t usually face, businesses looking for new clients, and corporations that don’t have a go-to provider for the said service.”
What we see now: There’s not quite a single marketplace for companies to go find work, as a whole. But a bunch of “gig economy” services, like Upwork and Fiverr, allow freelancers and small businesses to find clients.

To get to the anchor store, I passed a number of vacant retail spaces ready to be leased. This has been a common sight, but one of those spaces has been occupied by the US Postal Service. Then, I reached a Macy’s. From the outside the store looked closed, but the door opened. From the looks of it, the US Postal Service looked like a new addition but Macy’s appeared to be on its last leg.
People have mail to send, and the Postal Service might lure some people into the mall. While they’re shopping, they can also visit the gym and fill their banking needs. It seems retail establishments have a lot of space available but not enough stores looking for a physical presence. Eventually, landlords are going to accept any tenant looking for the space.
Many malls and shopping plazas are going to look different in the future. In fact, former retail stores are going to be filled with all sorts of other necessities. Retail has been changing for decades, but not all locations reflect the current climate. Empty spaces need to be used, and shopping centers designed for 2001’s economy aren’t meeting 2021’s standards.
What Can Be Done With Empty Retail Space?
As the world changes, so do the needs of communities. JCPenney used to be able to flourish in suburban areas, but now Target and Amazon fill those needs. JCPenney is moving out of the suburbs, and the vacant space needs to make money. Exactly how it becomes profitable will vary across locations.
Housing
Cities and suburbs have a declining need for physical retail spaces, but that doesn’t mean people are leaving these areas. It’s quite the opposite, with cities looking for locations to build new housing developments. In some areas, abandoned retail spaces have become residential areas. This might be the best of both worlds: people have more housing available and a decaying eyesore is repurposed.
There are some reasons not to transform a mall into housing. The space might be underutilized, but stores in operation still generate revenue for the state through sales tax. In parts of California, this issue seems to stall projects. Housing remains in high demand, but Macy’s has the power to retain its lease and prevent any condos from replacing their retail presence.
Office Space
In a world where people prefer to shop online, they can also be found using their office equipment for personal matters. This is why Cyber Monday was invented; people search for holiday deals when they return to the office after Thanksgiving. In order for this to happen, office spaces need to exists. Some companies are eying unused retail space as the home of their next staff meeting. In Michigan, Ford is looking to build offices in a closed Lord & Taylor.
Meanwhile, space in the Westside Pavilion in Los Angeles is being turned into office space. Former-stores can serve as an affordable option for open offices. Construction on the LA project began in 2019, and anticipated openings in 2022 and 2023. In some cases, offices make more sense than retail establishments. While they may not generate revenue through state sales tax, offices can be more reliable tenants than retail stores.
Time will tell if this strategy remains feasible. Offices are going remote, but that doesn’t mean all companies want to be 100% digital. If Google wants to open a new complex, they have the money to make it happen and push forward with scheduled projects. However, offices might not have the impact anticipated in 2019.
A New College Environment
The Highland Mall in Austin, Texas is one of the many establishments to lose their JCPenney. When the vacancy found a tenant, it wasn’t another anchor store. Austin Community College rented the space to use it as a learning center. Inside, students will find labs, computers, and spaces for group work. The squarefootage inside the former JCPenney allows students to access services and resources in a single location and encourages student success.
Throughout the United States smaller retail spaces have also been converted to satellite campuses. This was once viewed as a liability, as landlords worried universities wouldn’t mesh with other mall clientele. Then, they saw the hundreds of young adults commuting to classes. These students are potential shoppers, and they increase traffic. Stores and restaurants can benefit from these individuals, and this allows the satellite campuses to become worthy investments.
Discount Retailers
Often, it seems like malls aspire to host luxury brands. While high-end retailers like Louis Vuitton may appeal to wealthier customers, discount stores seem to be more popular. Stores like TJ Maxx and Marshall’s have managed to keep customers coming in their doors. As people spend more time in their homes, they’re looking to save on clothing and improve their living area. These stores allow shoppers to do both, and they offer an experience that cannot be recreated online. Each store has its own selection of merchandise, and bargain hunters enjoy the thrill of visiting the stores for their unique offerings.
Meanwhile, low-cost stores like Five Below continue to expand. Essentially, this is a dollar store for the modern era, but it places an emphasis on younger consumers. By following trends and keeping costs low, they’re bringing teens into malls. The store also offers a lot of simple essentials, the types of things people need fast but don’t want to spend a significant amount of money buying. This has made the stores profitable, and their expansion indicates that there’s plenty of retail space for more stores in the budget-friendly category.
Amazon Takeover
As e-commerce continues to overtake physical retail, its seems appropriate for Amazon to fill the vacant spaces left behind by departments stores. Amazon has been eyeing locations once filled by JCPenney or Sears. In many ways, this makes sense. Amazon will have a hard time finding sizable locations in urban areas. If a department store is now closed, this space will be adequate for a fulfillment center. From a business standpoint, this may be the death of malls as we know them. It’s easy to understand why retailers like Simon Malls would be hesitant to welcome Amazon.
Fortunately, Amazon may be adding more than just fulfillment centers. In some areas they may be looking to expand their grocery presence. While this holds implications for their delivery services, these stores will also offer a more traditional shopping experience. This way consumers will have access to faster grocery deliveries while people can also opt to shop in-store if they prefer.
What Will Happen to Abandoned Retail Spaces?
Businesses want to stay afloat, and states want to keep bringing in sales tax. When stores start closing, other stores will have the easiest time expanding into the open spaces. This means discount retailers will have an easy time acquiring vacancies. Profit margins on items might be lower at a store like TJ Maxx, but they can more-than make up for that with the number of transactions. Plus, other stores want traffic. If a popular chain can attract customers in a new location, the neighbors will appreciate the visibility and inevitable increase in visitors.
Vacancies outpace the expansion of low-cost stores, and this is when retail is going to start to change. The biggest spaces in the mall may no longer be retail anchors, but they may be anchors of a community. Housing, offices, and college campuses will certainly increase the number of people in specific locations. The intent may not be to shop, but proximity will play a huge factor. When lunchtime comes, those workers are going to leave the building and head over to Sbarro, Panda Express, or Starbucks. Then, they might stop into Gamestop or Urban Outfitters before they head home.
Of course, there will be places that can’t find anyone to acquire the space. In such cases, Amazon might be the best option. There’s no denying the importance of e-commerce, and additional locations will allow Amazon to distribute products more efficiently. With the rise of Amazon will come an increased need for returns. In these cases, the space outside of the warehouse is still important. Regardless of the scenario, the US Postal Service will get used. Communities still have needs, and retail spaces can condense a bunch of services into one hallway. Empty stores will get filled, even if they’re not with retailers.
Dying malls might still have value, but they will start looking a lot different than they did in 2001. In the future, they could become micro-communities. One hallway could have a coffee shop, post office, gym, and Banana Republic. At the end, there’s a warehouse or housing complex. The use of the space is going to change, but this transition may ignite a potential that was once lost.

I don’t always love Gartner and a lot of times they survey HR leaders as “top leaders in the business,” which is utterly laughable, but let’s still try to unpack this for a second. Number 1 is growth, which should surprise no one. That’s often all CEOs ever discuss. If their wife asks for a name for the second child, they might reactively say “GROWTH!” then realize it needs to be “David” to please their own father, whose acceptance they have sought since that grounder got through their legs at six. Why do you think they stepped on so many necks to rise up the ladder? Hug me, daddy. I digress. So growth is logical.
    “Technology-related” is as vague as most Facebook statuses, so that’s comical. Financial in (4) slot is comical too. Financial should be right below growth. I love how “customer,” which influences all these other things — uh, who buys your shit? — is somehow Number (6). LOL. “Customers? No time. Got a few other priorities, including, I believe, technology-related ones.”
    Cost containment / cost control is only so low because executives don’t want to admit it’s a priority. Obviously it is, to all of them. They just think it’s a bad thing to say on surveys, like they should be mentioning productivity and innovation and culture and whatever else. So they don’t say it, but it’s absolutely their top 1–2 priorities. If you ever do ghostwriting for companies, which I do, I can tell you everyone wants to position their product as “this will save you money.” It doesn’t matter what the product is. It’s almost always a core part of the positioning.
    As we get down to the bottom of this particular chart, finally you have a reference to COVID — at the absolute bottom. Now, the way this is worded is important. It says something about “overcoming COVID impact,” and the reality is, to many the “impact” might be overcome already, in that revenues went up, their compensation went up (in many cases), and they fired some dead weight (same). So the “impact” is inherently fine. But it speaks to a bigger point.
    Aside from having to make a decision about office space, and aside from fear of potential lawsuits and what to do with mandated vaccinations, how much do CEOs care about this anymore? A lot of industries had record 2020s. If you weren’t in hospitality or service/retail, you probably did fine, made good money, made money for yourself, pleased your wife, pleased your dad, kept the trappings, etc. Now the CDC is pivoting like an athletic center in the post, and you’re tired of all this shit. You have some big decisions to make, sure — if your peers and contemporaries mandate vax, should you? — but you’re kinda over it. Aren’t we back to just focusing on growth and, uh, er, “technology-related” things now?
    It seems like CEOs just want to get back to normal biz, which is a constant focus on growth and having people physically in the offices, which is why we’re seeing those WFH proclamations walked back now.
    What do you think? Does COVID still matter to the top dogs?', category: business)

article53 = Article.create(title: 'The GameStop Fiasco Proves We’re in a ‘Meme Stock’ Bubble', author: '
James Surowiecki', url:'https://marker.medium.com/gamestop-proves-were-in-a-meme-stock-bubble-b3f39163a77f', time: 6, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*3MN6QX978zrXE_iflM45Bg.jpeg', description: 'What the new dynamic between Redditors and Wall Street reveals about the stock market in 2021', content: 'Money Talks is a column that explores what happens when business, the economy, and culture collide.
GameStop is a struggling, kind of boring, mid-size retailer stuck in a legacy business — selling physical video games. But it’s also pretty much the only company anyone on Wall Street is talking about right now after its stock rose 160% in a matter of hours on Monday morning to an all-time high of $159. (By day’s end, GameStop’s price had been cut by more than half, but that still left it up more than 300% this year and almost 3,000% from its 52-week low. And it was up another 15% at Tuesday’s open.)
It isn’t GameStop’s precipitous rise, impressive as that’s been, that has everyone fascinated. Instead, it’s what is fueling that rise: concentrated buying by thousands upon thousands of small individual investors who are using sites like Reddit and Robinhood to drive up what are now being called “meme stocks.” GameStop is the best-known of these meme stocks, simply because its gains have become so outrageous. But it was preceded last year by Hertz and Kodak, which, despite having struggling businesses, saw their stock prices soar when they became Reddit darlings. And now stocks like AMC, Nokia, and Blackberry (which is, yes, still in business) have also caught Redditors’ fancy.
It’s easy to see the meme-stock boom as just a speculative bubble, and evidence of how the current stock market has lost touch with reality. Speculative bubbles in so-called “story stocks” are, after all, familiar things on Wall Street. In the late 1950s, uranium stocks soared, followed a few years later by bowling stocks, and then RV stocks. (In 1969, a company called Skyline Homes saw its shares rise twentyfold.) And we all know what happened to internet stocks in the late ’90s. But in fact, what’s happening with meme stocks is very different from those previous crazes.In a classic speculative craze, investors may take cues from each other — the fact that everyone is buying internet stocks makes you think it’s smart to buy internet stocks — but they’re not working together to make stock prices rise.
With meme stocks, on the other hand, that’s exactly what’s happening: The small investors on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit (which has 2 million subscribers) and other sites are taking part in a conscious collective effort to drive the prices of these stocks up. No one is in charge of this effort, though, of course, some voices are louder than others. But it is a self-organized campaign with people using the message boards to communicate with each other, encourage each other, and reassure each other (thus the many posts on r/Wallstreetbets admonishing fellow “autists” — their self-mocking term for each other — to not lose their nerve and to keep holding GameStop’s stock). Thus threads with titles “We are the captains now,” “Have no fear, GME gang. We are consolidating in preparation for tomorrow’s moon landing,” and “GME — it never has to end.”
In other words, what’s happening with GameStop looks less like a speculative bubble and more like a contemporary, internet-mediated version of the “bull raids” that were characteristic of the stock market in the early 20th century, when organized pools of investors would combine to drive stock prices up.
The traders on r/Wallstreetbets — which describes itself, tellingly, as “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal” — are trying to do the same thing to Wall Street.
Perhaps more interestingly, it also looks a lot like what happened during the 2016 presidential election. Over the course of that campaign, a loosely organized community of alt-right meme lords and their followers, centered on sites like 4chan and Reddit, adeptly used social media to elevate Donald Trump’s candidacy while barraging Hillary Clinton with an endless flow of memes targeting her supposed inauthenticity and corruption. What they did, in effect, was exploit the opportunities created by social media to disrupt the normal workings of the political system, at least in part for the lolz. The traders on r/Wallstreetbets — which describes itself, tellingly, as “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal” — are trying to do the same thing to Wall Street.
    How are they doing it? By embracing companies that Wall Street, for good reason, hates: beaten-down firms in legacy businesses with weak economic fundamentals. The Redditors don’t love these companies because they think their future prospects are genuinely great, even if in most cases there’s been some catalyst that suggests the underlying business could improve going forward. Instead, what meme stocks all have in common is that they start off with a cheap stock price and a relatively low market cap, and they’re heavily shorted, meaning that hedge-fund managers are betting that these stocks are going to fall. (GameStop, for instance, was and still is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on Wall Street.)
Both of those factors have been key to the success of these meme campaigns. First of all, stocks with single-digit prices tend to be more appealing to individual investors (even though the nominal price of a stock shouldn’t affect your willingness to buy it) because it’s more fun and easier to imagine making a lot of money quickly if you own 100 shares of a $4 stock rather than one share of a $400 stock. And because these companies have relatively small market caps and low floats (meaning not that many shares are outstanding), concerted buying pressure from individual investors can more easily move the price.
Going after heavily shorted stocks is also smart because it taps into the long-standing distaste for short sellers and gives meme-stock traders an enemy to focus on.
Targeting stocks that are heavily shorted, meanwhile, makes it possible to orchestrate short squeezes. When a heavily shorted stock jumps in price — because, say, a crowd of individual investors all decide to buy at once — short sellers that can’t take the pain start buying back shares to cut their losses. (In Wall Street parlance, they cover their short.) That drives the price higher, which in turn inflicts more pain on those short sellers who are still in, and so on. Meme-stock traders have also become adept at using options — which you can now trade commission-free on most online platforms — to create the same kind of positive feedback loop, with buying in effect begetting more buying.
Going after heavily shorted stocks is also smart because it taps into the long-standing distaste for short sellers, and gives meme-stock traders an enemy to focus on. Short selling is an essential component of any healthy stock market: Myriad studies have found that the presence of short sellers makes stock prices more accurate. But investors generally don’t care about whether stock prices are correct — they want stocks to go up. So anyone who is betting that stocks will go down is seen as a killjoy at best and an enemy of the state — or, in this case, of the community — at worst. That’s why, when well-known short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research said last week that GameStop’s stock price would fall to $20, he was savaged on social media and effectively cowed into silence.
The point, then, is that even though GameStop’s current stock price is utterly irrational — it will never make enough money to justify a $6 billion market cap — the way Redditors and others have driven its price up has been quite smart. They’ve shown, in a sense, that if you pick the right stocks, a self-organized community of small investors can make them rise, almost entirely by an act of collective will. In an odd way, it’s a remarkable testament to the internet’s ability to facilitate collective action. The challenge, of course, is that once that collective will begins to erode — either because people want to cash out or just get bored — there are going to be no fundamentals supporting the stock price, which means once these stocks start falling, it’ll be look out below. But by the time that happens, much of the crowd will have moved on. There are always going to be crappy, heavily shorted stocks out there—which means there’s always going to be a chance for more lolz.

Hit our engagement metrics this weekend!
The Tweet was accompanied by an engagement ring — which explained the kind of metrics Patrick was talking about.
Suhail Doshi, the founder of Mixpanel, was quick with a response:
That’s one way to increase user retention.
Yeah, it’s safe to say these guys have a great sense of humor. Which isn’t surprising, considering their seemingly absurd solution to online payments.
Instead of chasing 1000-hour programming contracts to build clunky payments solutions for each individual client, the Collison brothers built 7 lines of code that developers could simply plug into their websites.
The result is Stripe — a company that has more cash than it knows what to do with.
Here are the two main reasons why this worked so well.
1. They empowered developers.
When Stripe was launched in 2010, it was essentially a community of developers.
“Stripe caught on because it didn’t sell to companies,” said Dmytro Okunyev, who is the founder of Chanty. “It sold to developers. That is, Stripe offered an alternative to PayPal and Authorize that was so much easier to implement that developers around the world were naturally inclined to use it.”
See, back in 2010, setting up a payments system for your business was an extremely tedious process. Most integrations at the time took weeks and months to set up. It was an exhaustive process, involving several departments — from legal to accounting.
In most companies, financial integrations were a top-down decision that came from managers who knew little about the technical nightmare of the integration process. They would set arbitrary goals and deadlines, and pass the responsibility onto developers who had to outdo themselves in order to meet expectations.
Stripe changed all that by giving developers a quick and reliable way to set up payments. As a result, they built an army of champions for their product, effectively bypassing the “decision makers,” most of whom would have never believed that 7 lines of code can replace custom integrations that took up to 6 months to build.
2. They made payments ridiculously simple.
Banks. Credit card companies. Regulators. Yes, the payments industry has a lot of police officers. And you need to get approval from all of them before the dollars falling into your bank account are considered legal.
“For years, the explosive growth of e-commerce has outpaced the underlying technology; companies wanting to set up shop have had to go to a bank, a payment processor, and “gateways” that handle connections between the two. This takes weeks, lots of people, and fee after fee.” — Ashlee Vance, Bloomberg Businessweek
Stripe changed all that. Collison brothers spent 2 years testing their platform and building relationships with credit card companies, banks and regulatory institutions. John and Patrick spent countless hours presenting their product to authorities and building enough trust to partner with them. As a result, users only have to upload a couple of documents to set up their fully operational Stripe account.
Even Mike Moritz, one of Paypal’s first investors, agrees that setting up payments for businesses was way too complicated before Stripe:
“The observation that accepting payments was still too difficult rang very true,” Moritz said.
Another reason why Stripe blew up is because it was so universal. Platforms like Shopify and Lyft rely on payment simplicity — each additional step in account verification can mean millions of churned users. Stripe’s 7 lines of core code worked just as well in any environment, enabling billions of emerging platform users with same-week verification.
Stripe = Genius + Humility
There’s no going around the fact that the Collison brothers are aggressively smart. Patrick quit high school a year early to join MIT at the age of 16, only to drop out a year later to raise cash for his first startup, Shuppa. He soon sold the startup to Auctomatic for $5 million.
Tim Ferriss, who interviewed Patrick, says that the entrepreneur is probably the most aggressive reader he’d ever met — and that means a lot coming from a guy who’s interviewed hundreds of top performers. Derek Anderson, the founder of Startup Grind, has publicly called Collison a genius.
However, genius alone didn’t get Patrick to where he is today. The Collisons were born in a small Irish town, and their humble, problem-solving, product-first approach is what turned them into a massive success.
“They have the advantage of coming to California without being tainted and polluted by what’s in the water supply and air of Silicon Valley,” says Moritz, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a Stripe board member. “They’re more humble and well-rounded.”
Apparently, then, the good guys do win from time to time.', category: business)

Some of them can recite classic literature. Others will surprise you with their knowledge of current events. Many of them offer amazing advice. And yet, most of them still struggle to make a dent in the world.
Why is that? Why do they fail to get their careers and businesses off the ground?
Part of the answer lies in our definition of intelligence.
We’ve grown accustomed to defining intelligence as a combination of high IQ and high EQ. These are mostly inborn characteristics — which is convenient for us, since we can blame our lack of success on bad luck.
Although there is some truth to that. Research is piling up telling us that IQ is a “reasonable” predictor of financial success. However, as you very well know from your own life, that is not the entire truth, as there are plenty of high IQ individuals who live modest lives, and plenty of wealthy people who aren’t geniuses.
Steve Jobs: “You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does”
Recently, I’ve come across a video where a young Steve Jobs explains a key characteristic of what he considers to be a smart person.
I expected to hear something among the lines of “thinking out of the box” and “unflinching dedication.” Instead, I discovered one of the most profound pieces of advice I’ve ever heard.
“A lot of [what it means to be smart] is the ability to zoom out, like you’re in a city and you could look at the whole thing from the 80th floor down at the city. And while other people are trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B reading these stupid little maps, you could just see it in front of you. You can see the whole thing.”
Jobs masterfully notes that smart people often make connections that seem obvious to them, but perplexing to others — simply because they have developed the skill of “zooming out” to get a better view of the big picture.
This, of course, sounds great and we can all agree that in order to change the world you need to clearly see the world. But how do you do that? How do you increase your intelligence to become what Jobs considers to be a “smart” person?
According to the visionary — it’s all about having unique life experiences.
“You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does, or else you’re gonna make the same connections and you won’t be innovative. […] You might want to think about going to Paris and being a poet for a few years. Or you might want to go to a third-world country — I’d highly advise that. Falling in love with two people at once. Walt Disney took LSD, do you know that?”
It makes sense. A 2015 study has concluded that openness to experience was the best predictor for “job performance in situations requiring creativity,” which is every entrepreneur’s bread and butter. It’s also safe to say that any significant career step up will require a decisive innovative move.
The study also found that extraversion “played a key role in contexts involving social interactions,” which is hardly a surprise, but a healthy reminder nonetheless. These findings tie in nicely with what Jobs said — people who are open to experience and extroverted will seek out the most interesting, non-standard situations in life — and gain invaluable perspectives as a result.
Jobs’ idea also helps explain why so many successful entrepreneurs are avid readers. Divyank Turakhia, a 35-year old Indian tech billionaire, has once said that since the age of 15 he has read for 800 hours a year, every year. Tobias Lütke, Shopify’s billionaire founder, was described by Tim Ferriss as one of the most aggressive readers he’d ever met.
It’s probably not the information itself that these leaders value about books, but rather how they change their perspective. On Ferriss’s podcast, Lütke went in-depth about the books that changed his life — carefully describing each one of them.
Books are the easiest way for introverts to gather unique insights that shape their own worldview. They expand your mental horizons, so it makes sense that someone who’s read 100 classic business books can spot a rising trend or a missed opportunity before anyone else.
Experiences Are Everything
As with most great pieces of advice, this idea by Steve Jobs prompted a “damn, he’s right” moment in my head.
Some time ago, I did an exercise where I tried to recall the key turning points in my life. After a while, I realized that it was never a “genius idea” or “an amazing realization” that shaped my path — but people.
I’d meet someone. I’d have my core assumptions challenged. We’d do something together that I’d never think of doing on my own. In the end, I’d be left with experiences and lessons that I never would’ve been able to get just by my own intellectual effort.
Jobs himself was highly inspired by Buddhism, which he explored in his college years. The Zen philosophy’s keywords — simplicity, empathy, and mindfulness — are not at all alien to Apple’s products.
It’s not necessary to travel or take LSD to gather interesting experiences and form value-adding perspective of the world. Your vehicle of choice could be reading, or devouring online courses. Mine is meeting really interesting people and then getting to the bottom of who they are.
But the rule of thumb is clear: if you want to be truly smart in today’s professional world, you have to gather experiences that few others in your tribe have. That’s how you learn to see things in a way that might be called visionary.', category: business)

This year there may be even more reason to think long and hard before going to business school.
First, you’ll face unusually stiff competition. Applications at top schools are way up as people look for shelter from the economic storm caused by Covid. Plus, the virus may continue to disrupt in-person instruction, so you could end up battling your way in just to study online.

Skills beat degrees.

Instead of going to school to master back-office intricacies, he encourages would-be business leaders to focus on learning what it takes to actually make things. That belief is reflected in his approach to hiring — Musk focuses on skills not degrees, and isn’t bothered by candidates without formal credentials.
Could you save several hundred thousand dollars if you too focused on skills rather than credentials? There are tons of great resources, from online classes to recommended reading lists, out there to help you plug gaps in your business knowledge. And a new one might be of particular interest to those tempted by top-tier business schools.
Degree comparison portal DegreeQuery recently dug into publicly available syllabi from Ivy League schools to find the most assigned books in various subjects. If you’re looking to craft a DIY business degree, you could do a lot worse than starting with their list of most popular business books assigned at Ivy League schools:
Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking by M. Neil Browne. This book “helps bridge the gap between simply memorizing or blindly accepting information, and the greater challenge of critical analysis and synthesis,” according to Amazon.
Organizational Culture and Leadership by Edgar H. Schein. A classic textbook on, you guessed it, organizational culture and leadership.
Essentials of Organizational Behavior by Stephen P. Robbins. This textbook is now in its 14th edition, so it must be pretty useful.
The Management of Innovation by G. M. Stalker and Tom Burns. Published in 1961, this is “one of the most influential books about business organizations ever,” Amazon claims.
Business Finance: Theory and Practice by Eddie McLaney. Save yourself even more by checking the older editions of this one — the price drops from $75 to $3.
A Theory of Human Motivation by A. H. Maslow. Heard of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? This is where the idea comes from.
Critical Analysis of Organizations: Theory, Practice, Revitalization by Catherine Casey. This doesn’t look like a light read at all but it tackles an interesting theme: new, critical takes on the subject of organizations and how people behave within them.
Defining Moments: When Managers Must Choose Between Right and Right by Joseph Badaracco. A discussion of navigating those moments when your business and values are in conflict.
Business Intelligence and Analytics: Systems for Decision Support by Efraim Turban. “The only comprehensive, up-to-date guide to today’s revolutionary management support system technologies,” says Amazon.
Corporate Finance by Jeffrey F. Jaffe, Stephen A. Ross, Randolph Westerfield. Another classic textbook, now in its 11th edition.', category: business)

Good.', author: 'Brian Merchant', url:'https://onezero.medium.com/uber-and-lyfts-business-model-may-be-dead-good-53940dcbac34', time: 8, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*a0oRDM9vCeQTYr-GJfAAwQ.jpeg', description: 'The biggest startups in modern history were built on old-fashioned worker exploitation. Time for an upgrade.', content: 'Uber is less a business than a constellation of fantasies. The same goes for Lyft.
Early on, Uber and Lyft positioned themselves as “ridesharing” companies that were a key part of the buzzword-emblazoned “sharing economy.” Uber offered luxury on demand, and Lyft claimed to be a fun, environmentally friendly alternative to taxis. Both sold themselves as efficient and city-friendly and promised to help cut down on miles traveled. That was a fantasy that evaporated before the first pink Lyft mustaches fell off the bumpers. The vast majority of rides turned out to be single-passenger trips, the intent was clearly never to reduce anything, and the startups, in fact, began to contribute seriously to congestion.
The companies promised a new model of work, one that would give rise to a network of part-time drivers, “independent contractors” who were free to come and go as their schedules demanded in between pursuing their true dreams and ambitions. That too was a fantasy. Research has revealed that while a majority of drivers do log part-time shifts, most of the work is actually done by dedicated full-time drivers. As one recent study found, “a majority of the trips are completed by drivers who are committed to and rely on” driving for the platform. (That study also found that 83% of full-time drivers purchased their vehicles to provide taxi services and that 72% of full-time drivers rely on driving as their sole source of income.) The company is staffed by what most people would recognize as “employees,” in other words.
    Uber and Lyft sold themselves to investors as world-beating operations that would capture whole markets and then become profitable at scale. Surprise — pure fantasy. Even after a decade, neither company has managed to turn a profit. The startups sold themselves to cities as creators of good jobs and providers of new transportation options. But the cities were hoodwinked by the fantasy, too — those jobs are precarious and low-quality; many workers hover around or below minimum wage and must clock dangerously long hours to hit ride targets and surge rates. Taxi drivers, meanwhile, were pushed out of business by the venture capital-fueled companies and are despairing. And city streets are more gridlocked than ever.
    Then there was the greatest fantasy of all, written directly into each company’s IPO documents, that soon — soon, within a matter of years even — the ride-hailing business would be turned over entirely to a fleet of autonomous cars, thus eliminating the pesky need for human labor entirely. It’s not really fair to call that a fantasy — it’s more of a delusion. For the foreseeable future, functional and safe self-driving commercial taxis remain a recklessly pursued mirage; Uber’s autonomous test vehicles have already struck and killed a pedestrian.
    There is so much wishful thinking stamped into Uber and Lyft’s DNA, so much self-mythologizing, so much sheer venture-capital-fueled optimism that it can be easy to forget about or ignore the single element that is holding any semblance of viability for the two unicorns together: human workers. Drivers are the one part of the rideshare mythological complex that are decidedly not a fantasy, that actually work — but they are rewarded the least. Uber and Lyft’s early investors became millionaires and billionaires when the companies had their IPOs, their founders and executives have grown fabulously wealthy, and their ranks are lined with power players from the upper echelons of the Obama administration. Drivers, meanwhile, often make less than $10 an hour after maintenance and gas expenses are accounted for, and many struggle to make ends meet. (Because Uber and Lyft do not make their data publicly available, it is hard to confirm these figures — a recent Cornell study calculated higher wages after its researcher was selected by Uber to be given rare access to its data but was criticized by other researchers for framing its findings more favorably to the company.)
    So, when Uber and Lyft’s most dedicated drivers stood up, organized into groups like Gig Workers Rising and Rideshare United, asked for fairer treatment, pushed lawmakers, and approached the brink of actually attaining it — well, now all these fantasies might finally come crashing down. A California judge ruled last week that Uber and Lyft must immediately begin observing the AB5 law that went into effect at the beginning of 2020 and classify drivers as employees, not independent contractors.
    Unlike independent contractors, employees are eligible for things like minimum wage, overtime pay, worker’s comp, health care benefits, paid rest time, and reimbursements for driving costs — the basics. Full-time Uber and Lyft drivers get none of the above. Uber and Lyft have long argued that those drivers — the people physically driving customers from one location to another — are not “core” to its business, arguing that they are technology companies, not transportation companies, so they do not have to consider them employees. Of course, without drivers, there is no service, so there would be no Uber or Lyft at all, and it is hard to imagine a component more central to a car-hailing business than the person who drives the car that has been hailed. (The California ruling noted this proposition as particularly absurd, pointing out that the “entire business is that of transporting passengers with compensation.”)
    If anyone once bought into the fantasy of an algorithmically designed future of piece work, the reality should be clear by now — that’s simply a world where workers compete for gigs by signaling their availability for jobs on smartphones.
    After the ruling, both Uber and Lyft threatened to exit the state entirely if their legal appeals were defeated. Amazingly, this was less than 48 hours after Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi proclaimed in a New York Times op-ed that “gig workers deserve better.” If that means allowing the drivers who make his service possible to have basic employee benefits, though, he’d apparently rather shut the whole thing down.
    Lyft meanwhile, was more straightforward in its appeal — it said that if it had to classify its workers as employees, it simply couldn’t afford to operate.
    If that is true, and it may well be, then it is time to talk about fantasies again. Lyft and Uber are basically making the case — and making it openly — that their businesses are not viable if they must guarantee their workers minimum wage and basic protections. That the people who make Lyft and Uber possible are so poorly paid and so precariously employed that granting them the benefits of, say, In-N-Out cashiers or Target warehouse workers would bankrupt these mammoth Silicon Valley behemoths. Which makes it a particularly sad fantasy indeed.
    The Uber-Lyft brain trust and its supporters are clinging to the last line of fantastical argument — that this new model of work is so flexible and revolutionary that it demands a “third way” as Khosrowshahi wrote in his op-ed — and that it should exist outside the bounds of basic labor law. That old rules do not apply. That the government should help enact a slush fund or a meager stable of minor supports for precarious workers, given that companies like Uber and Lyft have created so many of them, to subsidize their benefits. (Remarkably, Khosrowshahi says that under his proposed system, after working an entire year, a full-time driver would be able to accrue around $1,350 worth of benefits; in his words, that’s “enough to cover two weeks of paid time off, or the median annual premium payment for subsidized health insurance.” Two weeks of time off or bare-bones health care. Not both. Talk about grim.)
    But I hope we can see that for what it is at this point. It’s a desperate hail Mary aimed at rekindling the ghost of a deflating dream.
    This new model, it has become clearer as the fantasy fades, is really the oldest of the old models: That is, disrupting an entrenched business by finding a means — or excuse — to reduce labor costs and skirt regulations. Uber and Lyft are glorified taxi companies that fused slick-looking user interfaces to basic GPS technology, put the app on newly ubiquitous smartphones, and then pointed to this incremental technological step to justify sidestepping both taxi regulations and labor laws. This wasn’t a taxi service — it was app-enabled “ridesharing.” It’s hardly a new play, of course; using advances in technology to argue labor laws no longer apply to your business has been a practice embraced by bosses since the Industrial Revolution.
    But that constellation of fantasies nonetheless, for a while, held the enterprises aloft. Helped along by credulous press, Uber, Lyft, and its ilk seemed to be on the cusp of installing this “new model of work” as a norm. In a recent working paper, journalist Sam Harnett dissects how the boosterish mainstream tech press of the 2010s all but cheered Uber and Lyft into becoming a phenomenon, touting the “sharing economy” as an emergent force for good. Venture capitalists and deep-pocketed investors then rode the hype and juiced the company’s valuation into an absurdly unrealistic stratosphere. In fact, if each of these forces — the naively optimistic tech press, the disruption narrative-loving VCs, and the relentlessly self-promoting companies themselves — weren’t all feeding Uber and Lyft’s increasingly far-fetched mythologies, a different prospect might well have emerged. A more reasonable-shaped scenario wherein Uber and Lyft really were fun, friendly apps that rendered connecting some part-time drivers to far-flung riders in a modest market prospect, solving for some inefficiencies and matching idle vehicles to wayward people — not the most valuable startups in the world, the hyper-inflated harbingers for the future of transit and the future of work.
    Because, once again, the Uber-Lyft vision of those futures is terrible. If anyone once bought into the fantasy of an algorithmically designed future of work, the reality should be clear by now — that’s simply a world where workers compete for gigs by signaling their availability for jobs on smartphones, laboring at the whims of algorithms owned by billionaires that automatically assigned them their tasks, and making increasingly slimmer sums as more and more precarious workers joined the informal app-accessible work pools. All while companies like Uber and Lyft charge them steep rents for the pleasure of using their platform to find work.
    Which is why we should be glad these fantasies are coming crashing down now. And why it’s imperative they stay down. Because if this model were allowed to become standard, it would signal an even more precarious and hopeless future of work than the one millennials and zoomers are currently staring down — one with more platform work, less security, lower wages, and ever-larger slices of the gains funneled to the owners of the apps.
    Uber and Lyft are now trying to make a power play — they hope that by demonstrating that if they exit a state that tries to offer the meagerest of regulations, consumers and drivers will revolt. But it also appears that they are genuinely nervous now. Backing out of a market as large as California is a measure a business would only take if it were desperate. They have one last-ditch effort in the works to preserve their exploitative business model — a ballot proposition called Prop 22 that they have bankrolled with DoorDash to the tune of $100 million that would permanently enshrine gig workers as independent contractors in California. They hope they can bully voters into propping up an enterprise whose chief innovation is now fairly obviously worker exploitation.
    They will only succeed if we continue to believe in their fantasies.', category: business)

It’s ‘Demand Shock’ That’s Killing Our Economy.', author: 'James Surowiecki', url:'https://marker.medium.com/forget-shutdowns-its-demand-shock-that-s-killing-our-economy-3062e94c122e', time: 5, image: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*T87TX4nLdtMrF9CnaCKuLw.jpeg', description: 'Gyms, restaurants, and movie theaters are all reeling for the very same reason', content: 'Money Talks is a column that explores what happens when business, the economy, and culture collide.
OnJuly 11, the American economy hit a key milestone in its recovery from the coronavirus: the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World reopened. The world’s most popular theme park had been shuttered since March 16, and the expectation was that Disney lovers from across the U.S., frustrated after months indoors, would flock to Orlando. And in the weeks leading up to the reopening, Disney had more than enough reservations to fill the park to its new, limited capacity. But as reopening day approached, the number of Covid-19 cases in Florida began to rise, and in response people started doing something Disney visitors almost never do: cancelling their reservations. In the three months that have followed, customer traffic has stayed well below where Disney hoped it would be. The portion of visitors who are from out-of-state, who are the park’s most lucrative customers, has dropped below 50%. In September, Disney reduced opening hours at all its parks, and in early October, it said it would be laying off 28,000 workers.
Disney hasn’t been alone. Theme parks were allowed to open back up in most of this country this summer, and initially believed that pent-up demand would translate into a resurgence in traffic. Instead, attendance has been well below expectations — at Six Flags, for instance, it’s been around 25%–30% of capacity — and not by choice. Because of this, some park operators, like Hersheypark, have cut back hours, while others, like Cedar Fair, are just keeping some of their parks closed for the year. There’s no secret about why. As Six Flags CEO Michael Spanos said in a conference call with analysts: “What customers are telling us is when they see a flattening of the curve, they want to get out. We also see a chunk of guests that are saying that when they’re comfortable with the vaccine, they want to get out.”
As lockdowns have been lifted in most of the country and businesses have been able to reopen, that supply shock has waned, only for a new problem to emerge: weak demand.
What Spanos was describing is the new reality now facing entire clusters of American businesses — restaurants, movie theaters, airlines, gyms — and the economy more generally: Consumer anxiety over the continued spread of the pandemic is holding back the recovery by making it impossible to get back to business as usual. In the spring, the economy was crushed in large part by the lockdowns and restrictions imposed by states, which created what economists call a supply shock: businesses literally could not supply goods and services, because they were shut down.
But as lockdowns have been lifted in most of the country and businesses have been able to reopen, that supply shock has waned, only for a new problem to emerge: weak demand. In other words, a supply shock has been replaced by a shock to demand.
Some of the weakness in demand is because we’re on the verge of a classic recessionary cycle: Since the stimulus payments to unemployed workers ended in July, people either have less money to spend or are worried about spending it, which means businesses have less revenue, which makes them cut back on hiring and investment, which means less spending.
Half a dozen gym chains have filed for bankruptcy in recent months, including 24 Hour Fitness, the owner of New York Sports Club, and Gold’s Gym, with many of them permanently shuttering a majority of their locations.
But what makes this demand shock exceptional is that the U.S. still has 40,000 to 50,000 new Covid-19 cases and 600 to 700 deaths every day, and as a result lots of Americans are still leery of doing normal, not particularly indulgent things like eating out, going to the gym, or going to the movies. A recent survey by research firm Datassentials, for instance, found that 58% of those surveyed described themselves as “uncomfortable” with dining indoors, and 36% described themselves as “very uncomfortable.” Not surprisingly, then, no matter how creative restaurants get, traffic is still down sharply in most places, and 2.5 million restaurant workers who lost their jobs in April remain unemployed. Similarly, gyms have been open in most states for months now. But a recent survey of 5,000 gym-goers by RunRepeat found that 70% haven’t returned and 43% said they had no plans to go back. Half a dozen gym chains have filed for bankruptcy in recent months, including 24 Hour Fitness, the owner of New York Sports Club, and Gold’s Gym, with many of them permanently shuttering a majority of their locations.
Or take movie theaters. By September, theaters were open in 44 of 50 states, and Warner Bros. decided to go ahead with plans to release Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, which had been one of the most highly-anticipated films of the year even before the pandemic hit. Even though theaters in New York City and Los Angeles remained closed, Tenet opened on almost 3,000 screens across the country. But even as Tenet did big box-office numbers overseas in countries where the virus has been contained, it made just $9.4 million on its opening weekend, despite facing essentially no competition. The hope had been that Tenet would prove people were ready to go back to the movies. Instead, it proved most weren’t. Hollywood studios concluded there was no point in trying to release big films for the rest of the year, and pulled their tentpole films from the fall schedule. And thanks to the combination of consumer anxiety and the lack of new content, Cineworld, owners of Regal Cinemas, shut down all 536 of its theaters in the U.S., while AMC, the largest U.S. theater chain, says it could run out of cash by the end of the year.
This shouldn’t be a revelation. In fact, myriad studies have now shown that in the early days of the pandemic, people began voluntarily socially distancing and avoiding places they perceived as risky even before lockdowns were put in place. And if you go further back in history, during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, businesses stayed open in most cities, yet economic activity still fell sharply, and contemporary accounts suggest that the economy only started to rebound when people became less afraid of catching the flu. The point is that lifting stay-at-home orders and opening restaurants isn’t enough: Until consumers feel safe, they’re going to stay away.
In the wake of the spring lockdowns, a popular narrative emerged that the only thing holding back the U.S. economy were busybody government officials who insisted on keeping stuff shut down. And, to be sure, government-imposed restrictions are still playing a role in holding back the economy, particularly in states like California — which has yet to allow Disneyland, or movie theaters, to open. But what the experience of restaurants and gyms and theme parks is telling us is that the problem now isn’t lockdowns. It’s something more basic: justifiable fear.', category: business)

By successfully predicting Armageddon, he walked away with huge returns that rivaled the protagonists of the cult film The Big Short. The untold story, however, details how some speculators continued to predict further economic collapse, thinking the world was about to end.
But despite the financial system literally breaking in half, the authorities’ combination of bailouts, liquidity injections, and “asset relief” programs restored confidence, and those bearish speculators went bankrupt. It was this extraordinary confidence revival that created the foundations for the longest bull market in history, the idea that you could ignore reality, zombify the economy, and get paid for it. Because why create an improved system free of all existing bad ideas when you can simply restart the profit machine, and convince everyone to play along?
Over the past decade, economic growth has halved while investors have put their faith in the Fed to prop up the economy, producing an absurd range of financial assets and systems created specifically to support them. Instead of savings, capital, and real wealth growing our economy, we have financial engineering: CDOs, CBOs, MBSs, and to back them up, a plethora of alphabet soup “asset relief” programs: CPFF, TALF, PDCF, SMMCF, TALF, MSCLF. You get the idea.
Financial institutions have been revived not via real economic growth but via leveraging debt-financed assets that would instantly go to zero in post-financially insane world. And as leverage has become the de facto funding source that the megabanks, hedge funds, pension funds, and insurance firms use to bankroll these products — generating huge returns for themselves — we’re about to experience the sharpest market crash on record.
To understand why let’s look at how Wall Street creates a CLO: a fancy name for fixed-income securities consisting of roughly 250 senior secured bank loans. Using a waterfall structure, the CLO manager packages loans into “tranches” of varying characteristics. Tranches at the top of the capital structure receive cash first, take losses last, but earn the lowest yield. The lower you go down the chain, the more potential losses and risk you take on, but with higher rates of return. By creating infinitely complex financial products, investors focus on the attractive yields, not the questionable assets hiding under the surface.
Wall Street then markets these CLOs to yield-starved investors who can’t get the same rate of return from U.S treasuries, dividend stocks, or corporate bonds. Let’s say a hedge fund has $200 million to spend, and they decide to buy the equity part of the CLO which has the highest yield but takes most of the losses. But since the Fed has announced it’s committed to bailing out almost anyone, the hedge fund won’t just purchase the CLO tranche outright. Instead, they will go to an investment bank for a billion-dollar loan, leveraging their capital five times.
As the financial system considers CLOs to be “assets”, the hedge fund can use their newly-acquired $1 billion CLO tranche as collateral to purchase even more assets. By exchanging that collateral for cash via money markets such as repo or interbank, the hedge fund can embark on an additional asset binge, using leverage to buy up mortgage-backed securities (MBS), junk bonds, REITs, stocks, and any other supposedly high-yielding assets. That original $200 million investment has turned into a vast portfolio of financial slop, but no one questions their motives or credit history because money is ultra-cheap. This hedge fund now has a leverage ratio of 20:1; their liabilities exceed their net worth by 20 times. What could possibly go wrong?
With the cheapest monetary environment on record, the state creating ever-increasing forms of moral hazard, and the Fed seemingly devising new bailout programs every week, the average leverage a hedge fund takes on has exploded to all-time highs. In fact, if you’re 10 times leveraged that’s considered conservative.
This, however, should come as no surprise as the Fed Put persists. Financial institutions have every incentive to use as little capital to buy up as many assets as possible to a point where this asset binge has made its way into every market: stocks, junk bonds, mortgages, bank loans; you name it. Before we only had a bubble burst in tech in 2001, then in real estate in 2007–2008. The next bubble to burst will be the bubble of everything.
This highly leveraged house of cards was tested by COVID-19. As investors started to sell anything the global lockdown might infect, a deleveraging event in the financial system caused the sharpest market decline in history, eclipsing the record from the 1930s Great Depression. A synchronized cross-market crash that Guggenheim CEO, Scott Minerd, described as “the Great Leverage Unwind”.
But the COVID-19 crash will be nothing in comparison to the next market crash. The historic rise in the Fed’s balance sheet illustrates how much money was needed to paint over the pandemic-induced cracks using — yes you guessed it — more leverage. The quality of assets has reached rock bottom while the leverage needed to finance their survival has increased to all-time highs. So when the next crash occurs, leverage on top of leverage on top of more leverage will have to be wiped out by the system to restore “stability”. It will be thrice as fast and thrice as sharp. It will be known as the Great Deleveraging: Part 2.
When the inevitable crash occurs, however, the Fed will again step in. But this time they’ll announce the outright purchase of stocks — which they can already achieve by lending money to primary dealer banks who then buy stocks on their behalf. The Fed will do this not because it has any effect on the system but because it will revive risk appetite enough to become self-fulfilling. They may even throw in a few more “asset relief” programs just for theatre — the SMR (Stock Market Relief) program has a nice ring to it. The Fed lies when it says stimulus stimulates the economy. Officials know it only encourages the big financial institutions to lend to firms that are on the verge of bankruptcy.
The amount of damage the Great Deleveraging: Part 2 inflicts on the system depends on what the Fed says and does. But judging by the market’s post-pandemic response, it’s almost a certainty — to the dismay of the sound money advocates, the Fed’s critics, the bears, the poor, and the young — that the financial behemoths will miraculously but blatantly save the biggest Ponzi scheme in modern history, and that we’ll continue to climb the wall of worry for months or years, maybe even decades, to come.', category: business)

', content: 'You don’t need flashy material items to be worthy of someone else’s time. But I learned that the hard way.
During my freshman year of high school, I started to become more conscious of what those around me thought was cool. As I walked through the long and narrow hallways every morning, it was hard to spot someone who wasn’t wearing at least one piece of designer clothing.
Up to that point, I had never felt any real pressure to dress a certain way in order to impress people.
Suddenly, I wanted to fit in with the crowd. Spending $100 on boots or $50 on a designer wallet seemed normal. During my high school years, I wasted a lot of money on material goods just so I could blend in.
And it was a huge mistake.
Still, it was a period of learning and growth for me. By the time I got to college, I realized that buying frivolous items I could barely afford was completely unnecessary.
Instead, I poured time into forming real relationships with people who didn’t care whether or not I carried a designer purse, and I found smarter ways to invest my money.
The following are five incredible purchases you can make in your twenties that have the potential to grow your wealth exponentially in the years to come.
1. This Transportation Essential
Having a reliable mode of transportation, such as a car, is very important. I personally waited until I was 21 to buy myself a car. Up to that point, my parents graciously let me use their old powder blue Town Car.
It was a pain to park because it was so large, but driving it for years allowed me to save up some extra money to put towards a reliable car that wouldn’t break down on me.
While I did purchase an older car, it only had about 50,000 miles on it when I got it, and it was extremely clean. I’ve had it for over two years now, and it’s proved to be a great purchase.
If you are also looking to buy a car, I recommend getting a used one, because the moment you drive a new car off the lot, it will depreciate in value.
According to Forbes:
“An automobile is a depreciating asset. As it ages, it loses value rapidly and drastically. There is very little chance an automobile used for personal transportation will appreciate in value.”
Therefore, buying a used car will save you money while still providing you a reliable mode of transportation to get you everywhere you need to go.
2. Education
An investment in knowledge can pay off immensely, so it’s one I highly suggest looking into.
I’m grateful I put money into furthering my education after high school. It was a lot of work, and definitely difficult at times, but I truly do believe that getting my bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering was worth the investment.
College might not be the right path for you. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest in furthering your education in some way.
There are many routes you can take, like online courses, two year programs, etc. that will help you gain more knowledge and experience at a lower cost. After all, knowledge is power.
3. Business Investments
This is the one that I would consider the most risky. You never know if a business venture is going to pay off and work in your favor.
But, in my opinion, it’s a risk you should be willing to take, especially when you’re young.
I’m sure you have heard the saying, “you have to spend money to make money”. This is definitely true in business.
As long as you research what you’re getting into, I think it’s ok to take a risk and invest some money in a potentially profitable business.
4. This Crucial Technology
Having a personal computer is more important than ever nowadays. Without a high quality laptop, I would never have been able to build my business.
My main source of income right now is blogging. Without a laptop, I would not have been able to type the article you are reading right now.
You may not think a high quality laptop is important, but it really is. Even if you don’t work online/remotely, much of the work people do today involves the internet.
In fact, Forbes states:
“Close to 40% of all jobs can be plausibly done from home.”
And if you add a side hustle to your typically 9–5 job, such as e-commerce, you’ll likely be able to make all the money back you invested in a laptop within a few months (or less).
5. The Biggest Purchase You’ll Ever Make
A house is the only purchase on this list that I have yet to make. And it’s one of the biggest purchases you’ll probably ever make. There’s a lot that goes into it, and you have to be financially ready for it, but it has the potential to be a phenomenal purchase.
According to Forbes:
“When you purchase a house, you are really getting two things. First, you are getting housing services, which is the most important part because everyone needs a place to live. Granted, when you rent, you also get housing services. Secondly, and significantly, when you buy a home and pay your mortgage, you are essentially being forced to save.”
There are also quite a few drawbacks to consider when buying a house, and it’s really more of a service than an investment. However, depending on where you’re at in your life, it could be the right move to help you save money in the long run.
I (unfortunately) have to rely on renting for the foreseeable future. I have moved around quite a bit since high school, and while I don’t know exactly where I will end up, I hope to be able to buy a home by my late twenties or early thirties.
There’s a good chance you will purchase a home at some point in your life, so you might as well start researching your options early on.
Final Thoughts
Making large purchases can be scary, no matter how old you are. However, if you invest your money in the right places when you’re younger, you can set yourself up for greater security and a greater quality of life in the future.
By spending money on necessities and profitable investments like my business, brand, and my car now, I know that I’m setting myself up for a better life in my thirties and beyond. And you can do the same.
If you do your research, save as much as possible, and invest intelligently, you’ll be well on your way to building your wealth for many years to come.
